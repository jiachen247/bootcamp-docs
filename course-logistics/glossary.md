# Glossary

## Front End

Also known as "front-end" or "frontend", front end refers to everything to do with the user interface of an application, and the logic that happens on the user's machine.

## Back End

Also known as "back-end" or "backend", back end refers to everything that happens behind the user interface, typically logic which gets executed "server-side", i.e. not on the user's device.

## Integrated Development Environment \(IDE\)

IDEs are programs in which software engineers write code. It's easier to code in IDEs than regular text editors because IDEs typically provide tools such as syntax highlighting, syntax formatting, and auto-completion that make coding easier.

## Command Line

The command line is a text-based interface that we can use to operate our computers through programs known as "terminals".

## Terminal

A terminal is an interface that we can use to operate our computers through a text-based "command line".

## Boilerplate

Code that is repeated in multiple places will little alteration. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate\_code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code)

## Application Programming Interface \(API\)

An API is an interface through which programmers can have computers perform pre-programmed logic. For example, data.gov.sg exposes an [API](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/realtime-weather-readings) for developers to obtain real-time weather information in their applications through the API. 

## Schema

Schema can refer to a few things, but in general it refers to a "blueprint" or "plan" for a database structure.

1. Relation or Table Schema
2. Database Schema
3. PostgreSQL Schema

See this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/298765) for a definition of \#1 and \#2, and [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-schemas.html) for \#3. We will rarely be using definition \#3 in SWE1.
