# Module 4 - Full Stack Application

**Complete Full Stack App with PostgreSQL**

Our app now serves complete HTML pages representing dynamic data inside our SQL database. We'll enhance the functionality of our app by adding front-end JS back into our stack.

We'll refactor our app so that it's more well-structured and easier to work on.

### **Week 1**

Front-end JS, Express file server, AJAX
