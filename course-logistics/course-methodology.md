# Course Methodology

## Base, Comfortable, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects in SWE1 may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

### Comfortable

The Comfortable section is for students that are able to complete Base and wish to practise more of the relevant concepts. This will help students solidify their understanding of the concepts and be better prepared for more complex exercises and projects.

### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries and have completed Base and Comfortable sections. Students can complete SWE1 successfully without ever touching More Comfortable, but students that can complete More Comfortable exercises may be more valuable in the job market.
