# Course Methodology

## Base, Comfortable, More Comfortable

To accommodate different learning speeds and prior experience, exercises and projects in SWE1 may have different sections to differentiate what must be completed to minimally understand concepts, and what are extra exercises or features to help solidify one's understanding.

### Base

Everything in the Base section must be completed to minimally understand relevant concepts. When short on time, we can complete the Base section then move onto the next exercise or project.

### Comfortable

The Comfortable section is for students that are able to complete Base and wish to practise more of the relevant concepts. This will help students solidify their understanding of the concepts and be better prepared for more complex exercises and projects.

### More Comfortable

The More Comfortable section is for students that wish to push their boundaries and have completed Base and Comfortable sections. Students can complete SWE1 successfully without ever touching More Comfortable, but students that can complete More Comfortable exercises may be more valuable in the job market.

## Recommended Order of Work

On any given day in SWE1, students will have Post-Class Exercises for the current day, Pre-Class Exercises  for the upcoming day, and potentially a multi-day Project. RA recommends that students prioritise the material in the following order.

1. Base section of Post-Class Exercises / Project
2. Pre-Class Exercises
3. Comfortable and More Comfortable sections of Post-Class Exercises / Project

## Exercise / Project Strategy

Please read through all sections of exercises and projects before starting. Later parts of exercises and projects may require different code architecture than earlier parts. If we plan on implementing later parts, we may want to design our code in a certain way to avoid lengthy refactoring later.

## In-Class Code Review

On days where we have longer post-class exercises or projects due, we will review each others' code in groups of 2-3 during class. If there is a group of 3, the triplet will do individual code review together so that everyone gets to review someone else's code, then split into 2 groups for pairing.

### Code Review - Individual

#### 1\) Clone Partner's Code

You'll be paired up so that you can exchange the links for your repos via Slack. Remember that the forked repo is the one that is under your GitHub account, not Rocket Academy's.

**If you have forked the repo, but you don't have the latest code on GitHub** take a moment now to do a `git push`. Let your partner know you're updating the repo.

Run a `git clone <repo-url> <new-folder-name>` to get a copy of your partner's code.

_Note: You need to rename the folder when you clone if you already have a folder named after the repo where you're making the clone._

#### 2\) Run Partner's Code

Open the code in the browser and test it. What does it do? If you're not sure what it does look inside the `script.js` to see.

#### 3\) Read Partner's Code

Read the code.

* How does it work?
* Does it have any obvious errors?
* Does it implement something that you were trying to do?
* Does it implement a feature that you haven't started yet? How does the code work?

#### 4\) Play with Partner's Code

It may be helpful to make changes to the code to help you understand it better. Write some `console.log` that would help you figure out what the code does. Break the code in a certain way to prove how it works or doesn't work.

#### 5\) Discuss

Once both partners are done with \#1-4, discuss what you saw.

### Code Review - In Pairs

You'll be pair programming on one person's project at a time. The goal is to get working versions for each person. **The driver will be the person who is \*not\* working on their own code.** 

Once done with one person's code, send the code to your pair \(it's their project\) via a [Slack code snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-sg/slack-tips/share-code-snippets). Switch to work on the other person's code.

_Note: If you are working on your partner's code you can't push to their repo because GitHub repos are read-only to non-owners by default._

If you both have working versions, implement a new feature in one of the projects together.
