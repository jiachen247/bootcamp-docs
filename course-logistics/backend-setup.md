# Back End Setup

## Mac

Make sure that your Mac is running the latest version of the OS that it can support.

### XCode

If you haven't already, [download XCode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) and/or make sure it's the latest version.

### XCode Command Line Tools

```bash
 xcode-select --install
```

### Homebrew

Follow the install instructions at: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

## Windows

Make sure that your OS is completely updated. You must be able to download things from the Windows Store.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux \(WSL\)

WSL allows us to run the Linux operating system on Windows machines. This is desirable because most programming is done on Unix-based operating systems, which include Linux and MacOS. Most SWEs using Windows machines at tech companies do their work in WSL to maximise compatibility between their work and that on Mac and Linux machines in the cloud.

1. Install WSL here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. Install the latest version of Ubuntu: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71)
