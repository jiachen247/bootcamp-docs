# 3.5.7: Database Setup Files

## Introduction

We will formalize a set of commands and files you can use to work with the database.

All the dummy data you need to properly setup and populate your app should be included in these files.

Remember that since your database itself is not in the repo, you need to be able to recreate the minimal setup your app needs to run in a set of repository-controlled files.

## init\_tables.sql

`init_tables.sql` will contain all of the `CREATE TABLE` statements needed to setup your app.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cats (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  type TEXT,
  weight INTEGER
);
```

Run the SQL against your database:

```text
psql -d recipes -U kai -f init_tables.sql
```

Adding the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` syntax means that you can run the above command in `psql` as many times as you want and it will not cause any errors.

## seed.sql

```sql
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Mr. Snuggles', 'Calico', 327);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Jake AlPurrrrtsen', 'Bambino', 424);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Furry Mc Furmeister', 'Persian', 512);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Kai', 'LaPerm', 387);
```

Run the SQL against your database:

```text
psql -d recipes -U kai -f seed.sql
```

## dropdb

Start from scratch again by dropping the entire database.

```text
dropdb recipes -U kai
```
