# 3.5.11: Uploads

## Setup

Just like we did with request.body, we need to add configuration to express to allow it to accept a new kind of data in the request. In this case we are talking about binary file data in the request.

### Multer

Install multer. This puts the file key on the request obkject and automatically names the files that get put onto the server harddrive.

```bash
npm install multer
```

### Set it up in Express.js

This setup requires that you have a directory in your repo where the files end up:

```text
mkdir uploads
```

We want Git to save the _**existence**_ of the directory, but not commit any of the actual files- just like the database, the contents of the folder itself are not part of the application code.

**.gitignore**

```text
uploads/*
```

#### index.js

```javascript
import multer  from 'multer';

// set the name of the upload directory here
const multerUpload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });
```

## Express.js

#### upload.ejs

```markup
<form action="/profile" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="avatar" />
    <input type="submit" value="submit" />
</form>
```

#### index.js

```javascript
app.get('/profile', (request, response) => {
  response.render('upload');
});

app.post('/profile', multerUpload.single('avatar'), (request, response) => {
  
  console.log( request.file )
  
  response.send('worked');
})
```

In `app.post` we pass in `multerUpload`. We call this function with the **same** `name` attribute we have in the form.

#### request.file

```javascript
{
  fieldname: 'avatar',
  originalname: 'hickey.png',
  encoding: '7bit',
  mimetype: 'image/png',
  destination: 'uploads/',
  filename: 'b6c6612935244b080fc2daa81ac1b3b8',
  path: 'uploads/b6c6612935244b080fc2daa81ac1b3b8',
  size: 422224
}
```

In a normal app we would take the information passed to us in `request.file` and use it to populate the database. Notice how the file is a cryptographic hash, and there is no file extension.

## Recording File Uploads

Put the filename in a new row in the database.

## Getting File Uploads Back Out

Reference the location of the file in the filesystem and use it to create an `img` tag, so that the HTML page can make a request, and Express.js can server the file back out.
