## Intro to Database Servers

![](../../.gitbook/assets/sql-database.jpg)

In this module we'll learn about how to create, manage and deploy the PostgreSQL server.

Note that this is different from managing the data _**inside**_ the database, which is done using the SQL language.

Express.js, the application itself \(except for less common application types\) will never manage the data format- how many tables are in the database, what the data types of the columns are. We'll learn more about setting this up in schema design. The database schema is part of the application code, but not part of the running Express server.

Also, unlike the `data.json` file we used prior to SQL, the data inside the database **is not** part of the application repo/code/project.

Managing the PostgreSQL server application itself, i.e. ports, backups, version upgrades to PostgreSQL, etc. is done by the person responsible for infrastructure.

## Intro to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL \(or Postgres for short\) is the database application server that we will be using. Other popular SQL implementations are MySQL and SQLite, but PostgreSQL is a good generalist implementation with a good balance of lightweight and feature-rich.

Postgres implements the SQL language in order to store and retrieve data from a set of files on the hard drive.

Postgres is a server application that uses it's own TCP/IP protocol, usually on port 5432 \(although this is configurable\). Requests are sent to the server that contain the SQL language queries for the server to process. The result of the queries is sent back to the client.

Postgres is a software implementation of a database system. So far we've only dealt with a database at a conceptual level, and using that database though SQL.

However, a database system is the actual implementation of something that runs SQL and keeps the data. Each system implements the SQL language slightly differently, keeps the data on the disk in a slightly different way, and gets the data back out differently.

The database system ensures fundamental database properties like [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). A database system needs to account for circumstances like when two opposing queries happen at the same time, or like when a long running INSERT query fails while executing, due to something like power failure. The system doesn't solve these problems, but it is guaranteed to behave in a consistent manner each time.

A database system also build functionality for things like automatic backup of the data to another computer, and things for speeding up queries like column indexes.

## psql and psql Setup

**psql** is the command line client for Postgres to access our databases from the command line. For our initial engagement with SQL we will use `psql` to get used to writing raw SQL queries.

### Mac

Install [postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/). Open the application and follow the setup instructions at [postgresapp.com](https://postgresapp.com).

### Windows \(in WSL\)

Install Postgres

```text
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install postgresql
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

Set the Postgres server to start in the background:

```text
sudo service postgresql start
```

Set password-less login by opening pg\_hba.conf and copying the below contents into it.

```text
sudo chmod 777 /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

```text
# Open pg_hba.conf.
# "sudo" runs the command as the root user
# "$(which code)" gets the location of the VSCode application locally

sudo "$(which code)" /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
```

pg\_hba.conf contents to copy:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# IPv4 local connections:
local    all            all                                     trust
host     all            all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host     all            all             ::1/128                 trust
```

Restart Postgres to get the new configs:

```text
sudo service postgresql restart
```

Create a user and database named after your Ubuntu user:

```text
sudo su - postgres
createuser -s <MY_UNIX_USERNAME>
createdb <MY_UNIX_USERNAME>
```

Exit out of the `postgres` user

```text
exit
```

Test it:

```text
psql
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
On Ubuntu, when you restart your computer you may have to start the Postgres server with the following command.

```text
sudo service postgresql start
```

On Mac you should be able to start Postgres by opening the Postgres app.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To quit out of `psql`, use the command `\q`. For more `psql` commands, see the psql cheatsheet [here](https://gist.github.com/awongh/f15415716d538a68a7ac5f4ad28dfe3c).
{% endhint %}

## Exercise

Create a table and make SQL commands.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The CREATE TABLE is different from the SQL query in 3.4.1. This is because some SQL syntax is different in Postgres from SQLite.
{% endhint %}

### CREATE DATABASE

Run this on the command line \(outside of `psql`\). SQL queries below need to be run in `psql`.

```text
createdb cats
```

### CREATE TABLE

Notice that we are specifying the data type of the columns here. We'll specify all the possible data types later.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    weight INTEGER
);
```

### INSERT

Note that we are not specifying the id column in the INSERT statement.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Mr. Snuggles', 'Calico', 327);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Jake AlPurrrrtsen', 'Bambino', 424);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Furry Mc Furmeister', 'Persian', 512);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Kai', 'LaPerm', 387);
```

#### Primary Key

In this course, for every table, we'll be naming a column called id. A feature of SQL systems is that we can have an auto-incrementing column that give an automatic and guaranteed unique number for every row created. 

### SELECT

Get the name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT name FROM cats;
```

Get the id and name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT id,name FROM cats;
```

Get the same columns in a different order.

```text
SELECT name,id FROM cats;
```

Get all rows from all columns of this table. 

```text
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

### SELECT ... WHERE ...

```text
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id=1;
```

### UPDATE

```text
UPDATE cats SET name = 'Susan Chan' WHERE id=2;
```

### DELETE

```text
DELETE FROM cats WHERE id=2;
```

Note that a property of the unique `id` column is that if there is another insert query, the `id`s do not rearrange. Try this out by making a new `INSERT` query.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Chubby Pants', 'Calico', 433);
```

### SELECT ... ORDER BY ...

```text
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY name ASC;
```

### SELECT COUNT

```text
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM cats;
```
