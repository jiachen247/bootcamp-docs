# 3.5.1: PostgreSQL

![](../../.gitbook/assets/postgres.jpg)

PostgreSQL \(or Postgres for short\) is the database application server that we will be using. Other popular SQL implementations are MySQL and SQLite, but PostgreSQL is a good generalist implementation with a good balance of lightweight and feature-rich.

Postgres implements the SQL language in order to store and retrieve data from a set of files on the hard drive.

Postgres is a server application that uses it's own TCP/IP protocol, usually on port 5432 \(although this is configurable\). Requests are sent to the server that contain the SQL language queries for the server to process. The result of the queries is sent back to the client.

Postgres is a software implementation of a database system. So far we've only dealt with a database at a conceptual level, and using that database though SQL.

However, a database system is the actual implementation of something that runs SQL and keeps the data. Each system implements the SQL language slightly differently, keeps the data on the disk in a slightly different way, and gets the data back out differently.

The database system ensures things like [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). A database system needs to account for circumstances like when two opposing queries happen at the same time, or like when a long running INSERT query fails while executing, due to something like power failure. The system doesn't solve these problems, but it is guaranteed to behave in a consistent manner each time.

A database system also build functionality for things like automatic backup of the data to another computer, and things for speeding up queries like column indexes.

## psql

**psql** is the command line client for Postgres.

```text
psql
```

See the [psql cheatsheet here.](https://gist.github.com/awongh/f15415716d538a68a7ac5f4ad28dfe3c)

In this module we'll learn about how to create, manage and deploy the PostgreSQL server.

Note that this is different from managing the data _**inside**_ the database.

The web application itself \(Express.js\) is responsible for which data goes inside the database. \(Which rows are in the database\).

Express.js, the application itself \(expect for less common application types\) will never manage the data format- how many tables are in the database, what the data types of the columns are. We'll learn more about setting this up in schema design. The database schema is part of the application code, but not part of the running Express server.

Also, unlike the `data.json` file, the data _inside_ the database **is not** part of the application repo/code/project.

Managing the PostgreSQL server application itself, i.e., ports and backups version upgrades to PostgreSQL, etc. is done by the person responsible for infrastructure.

## Exercise

Create a table and make SQL commands.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The CREATE TABLE is different from the SQL query in 3.4.1. This is because some SQL syntax is different in Postgres from SQLite.
{% endhint %}

### CREATE DATABASE

Run this on the command line \(outside of `psql`\). SQL queries below need to be run in `psql`.

```text
createdb cats
```

### CREATE TABLE

Notice that we are specifying the data type of the columns here. We'll specify all the possible data types later.

```sql
CREATE TABLE cats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    weight INTEGER
);
```

### INSERT

Note that we are not specifying the id column in the INSERT statement.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Mr. Snuggles', 'Calico', 327);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Jake AlPurrrrtsen', 'Bambino', 424);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Furry Mc Furmeister', 'Persian', 512);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Kai', 'LaPerm', 387);
```

#### Primary Key

In this course, for every table, we'll be naming a column called id. A feature of SQL systems is that we can have an auto-incrementing column that give an automatic and guaranteed unique number for every row created. 

### SELECT

Get the name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT name FROM cats;
```

Get the id and name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT id,name FROM cats;
```

Get the same columns in a different order.

```text
SELECT name,id FROM cats;
```

Get all rows from all columns of this table. 

```text
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

### SELECT ... WHERE ...

```text
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id=1;
```

### UPDATE

```text
UPDATE cats SET name = 'Susan Chan' WHERE id=2;
```

### DELETE

```text
DELETE FROM cats WHERE id=2;
```

Note that a property of the unique `id` column is that if there is another insert query, the `id`s do not rearrange. Try this out by making a new `INSERT` query.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Chubby Pants', 'Calico', 433);
```

### SELECT ... ORDER BY ...

```text
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY name ASC;
```

### SELECT COUNT

```text
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM cats;
```
