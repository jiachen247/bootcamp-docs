# 3.5.6: Rendering Many-to-Many Forms

Just like when we rendered one-to-many forms, when creating a many-to-many relationship in the database we want to give the user the ability to choose from options without having to have them worry about database ids.

In the case of a many-to-many relationship with a join table, we can represent creating this relationship with check boxes.

A checkbox is the UI design element that represents zero or many selections of a category of thing.
