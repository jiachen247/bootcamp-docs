# 3.5.6: Rendering Many-to-Many Forms

Just like when we rendered one-to-many forms, when creating a many-to-many relationship in the database we want to give the user the ability to choose from options without having to have them worry about database ids.

In this example we'll construct a form that creates the set of rows in the relationship table that puts the recipe in a set of categories.

Unlike with the one-to-many example it's not even possible to create a single form input for the categories. We could have typed multiple numbers into the input \(e.g., 5,2,3,6,9\), but they would  have to be processed into an array in the route.

```javascript
<form action="/recipe/1/categories" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="category_id">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In the case of a many-to-many relationship with a join table, we can represent creating this relationship with check boxes.

A checkbox is the UI design element that represents zero or many selections of a category of thing.

We'll create a special route to put a given recipe into categories. It gets the same information as the previous example.

#### index.js

```javascript
app.get('/recipes/:id/categories/add', (request, response) => {

  pool.query('select * from categories', (error, result)=>{

    const data = {
      categories : result.rows
    };

    response.render('categories', data);

  });

})
```

#### categories-form.ejs

```markup
<form action="/recipie/<%= recipieId %>/categories" method="POST">
    <% categories.forEach((category) => { %>
        <label><%= category.name %></label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="sdfsdf" name="category_ids" value="<%= category.id %>">
    <% }); %>
    <input type="text" name="label">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Notice that this is going to render a checkbox for each existing category, every checkbox has the same input `name` attribute.

If all three categories are checked, the request will look like this:

Notice that the keys, or properties of the data being sent are all the same.

Express.js is smart enough to put these values into an array.

```javascript
app.post('/recipie/:id/categories', (request, response) => {
  console.log( request.body.category_ids ); // will be an array of numbers
  response.send('works');
});
```

 We need to be able to take these values and
