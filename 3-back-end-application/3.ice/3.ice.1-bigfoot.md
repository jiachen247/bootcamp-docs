# 3.ICE.1: Bigfoot

Create an Express.js app that displays Bigfoot sightings.

Start with [this repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/bigfoot-express-swe1)

### Index

```text
http://localhost:3004/sightings/0
```

When a request is made to sightings get the sighting that corresponds to the index in the request.

### HTML

When sending the response, create HTML to send back:

```text
app.get('/sightings/:index', (request, response) => {
    const content = `<html><body><h1>hello</h1></body></html>`;
    response.send(content);
});
```

Once you've constructed a basic set of HTML to send back, use the template literals `${}` to put sighting information `YEAR`, `STATE`, and `OBSERVED` into the HTML page.

Confirm that this functionality also works with `curl`.

### Questions

What happens if no response is sent back? What does that look like in the Chrome Dev Tools Network tab?

What are some keys in the `request` and `response` object? `console.log` them to see.

What are some other methods you can call on the `response` object? Look at the [Express.js docs here.](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res)

## Comfortable

Create a route that give a list of all the reports for a given year. You shouldn't print all the details of each report on only one page, so just print the year and state for each report \(item\) in the list.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings/1989
```

Note you don't need to send back HTML. 

## More Comfortable

### Sort By

Use the query string parameters to take in the order the user would like to sort the list by. The list is always sorted by state. The query parameter will say if the list should be sorted ascending or descending.

```text
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings?sort=asc
```

You'll be able to get a hold of this param in the request object:

```javascript
console.log( request.query );
```

See the [docs on query here.](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query)

Note you don't need to send back HTML.
