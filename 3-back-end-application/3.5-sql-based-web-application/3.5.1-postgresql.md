# 3.5.1: Postgresql

![](../../.gitbook/assets/postgres.jpg)

PostgreSQL is the database application server that we will be using.

Postgres implements the SQL language in order to store and retrieve data from a set of files on the hard drive.

Postgres is a server application that uses it's own TCP/IP protocol, usually on port 5432 \(although this is configurable\). Requests are sent to the server that contain the SQL language queries for the server to process. The result of the queries is sent back to the client.

Postgres is a software implementation of a database system. So far we've only dealt with a database at a conceptual level, and using that database though SQL.

However, a database system is the actual implementation of something that runs SQL and keeps the data. Each system implements the SQL language slightly differently, keeps the data on the disk in a slightly different way, and gets the data back out differently.

The database system ensures things like [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). A database system needs to account for circumstances like when two opposing queries happen at the same time, or like when a long running INSERT query fails while executing, due to something like power failure. The system doesn't solve these problems, but it is guaranteed to behave in a consistent manner each time.

A database system also build functionality for things like automatic backup of the data to another computer, and things for speeding up queries like column indexes.

### psql

**psql** is the command line client for Postgres.
