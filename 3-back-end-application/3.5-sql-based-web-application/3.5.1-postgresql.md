# 3.5.1: Postgresql

![](../../.gitbook/assets/postgres.jpg)

PostgreSQL is the database application server that we will be using.

Postgres implements the SQL language in order to store and retrieve data from a set of files on the hard drive.

Postgres is a server application that uses it's own TCP/IP protocol, usually on port 5432 \(although this is configurable\). Requests are sent to the server that contain the SQL language queries for the server to process. The result of the queries is sent back to the client.

Postgres is a software implementation of a database system. So far we've only dealt with a database at a conceptual level, and using that database though SQL.

However, a database system is the actual implementation of something that runs SQL and keeps the data. Each system implements the SQL language slightly differently, keeps the data on the disk in a slightly different way, and gets the data back out differently.

The database system ensures things like [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). A database system needs to account for circumstances like when two opposing queries happen at the same time, or like when a long running INSERT query fails while executing, due to something like power failure. The system doesn't solve these problems, but it is guaranteed to behave in a consistent manner each time.

A database system also build functionality for things like automatic backup of the data to another computer, and things for speeding up queries like column indexes.

### psql

**psql** is the command line client for Postgres.

```text
psql
```

See the [pqsl cheatsheet here.](https://gist.github.com/awongh/f15415716d538a68a7ac5f4ad28dfe3c)

To quit:

```text
\q
```

In this module we'll learn about how to create, manage and deploy the PostgreSQL server.

Note that this is different from managing the data _**inside**_ the database.

The web application itself \(Express.js\) is responsible for which data goes inside the database. \(Which rows are in the database\).

Express.js, the application itself \(expect for less common application types\) will never manage the data format- how many tables are in the database, what the data types of the columns are. We'll learn more about setting this up in schema design. The database schema is part of the application code, but not part of the running Express server.

Also, unlike the `data.json` file, the data _inside_ the database **is not** part of the application repo/code/project.

Managing the PostgreSQL server application itself, i.e., ports and backups version upgrades to PostgreSQL, etc. is done by the person responsible for infrastructure.
