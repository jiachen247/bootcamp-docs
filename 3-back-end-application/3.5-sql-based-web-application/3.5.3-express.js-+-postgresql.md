# 3.5.3: Express.js + PostgreSQL

For Express.js we'll be using a different pg syntax. Because when you run Express.js it is running and listening for requests, \(as opposed to a node CLI program that runs and exits\), we need a way to manage the database connections that Express.js is making and appropriately end those connections. pool automatically does that for us. The word pool refers to the fact that it manages connections through what they refer to as an available pool of connections. \(It's really just an array\).

Remember to install pg:

```text
npm install pg
```

#### index.js

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pg;

const pool = new Pool();

import express from 'express';

const app = express();

const PORT = 3004;

app.get('/', (request, response) => {

  console.log('request came in');
  
  const whenDoneWithQuery =  (error, result) => {
  
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error executing query', error.stack);
      response.status(503).send(result.rows);
      return;
    }
    
    console.log(result.rows[0].name);
    
    response.send(result.rows);
  };
  
  pool.query('SELECT * from users', whenDoneWithQuery);
});

app.listen(PORT);
```
