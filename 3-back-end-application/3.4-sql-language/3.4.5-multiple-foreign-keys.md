# 3.4.5: Multiple Foreign Keys

## Introduction

We saw with many-to-many relationships we can directly relate a given row in one table to any number of rows in another table and vice-versa. We accomplish this with a "join table", a table that contains only relational information. We'll expand our use of foreign keys so that we can associate 3 tables, but all with their own data.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT);

CREATE TABLE ingredients ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

CREATE TABLE recipe_ingredients ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, recipe_id INTEGER, ingredient_id INTEGER, measurement TEXT);
```

### Create Ingredients

```sql
INSERT INTO ingredients ( name ) VALUES ('fish ball');
INSERT INTO ingredients ( name ) VALUES ('soy sauce');
INSERT INTO ingredients ( name ) VALUES ('sesame oil');
```

### Create Recipes

```sql
INSERT INTO recipes ( label ) VALUES ('Udon');
INSERT INTO recipes ( label ) VALUES ('Mee Pok');
INSERT INTO recipes ( label ) VALUES ('Pasta');
```

### Check IDs

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
SELECT * FROM recipes;
```

### Create Measurements of Recipe Ingredients

Give Udon 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.

Give Mee Pok 4 fish balls and 2 tablespoons of sesame oil. 

This table doesn't just represent a relationship, but also has it's own data and references more than one table.

```sql
INSERT INTO recipe_ingredients ( recipe_id, ingredient_id, measurement ) VALUES (1, 2, '2 tbls');
INSERT INTO recipe_ingredients ( recipe_id, ingredient_id, measurement ) VALUES (1, 3, '1 tbls');
INSERT INTO recipe_ingredients ( recipe_id, ingredient_id, measurement ) VALUES (2, 1, '4');
INSERT INTO recipe_ingredients ( recipe_id, ingredient_id, measurement ) VALUES (2, 3, '2 tbls');
```

### Get All Recipes With Soy Sauce

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_ingredients WHERE ingredient_id=2;
```

### Get Udon Ingredients

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_ingredients WHERE recipe_id=1;
```
