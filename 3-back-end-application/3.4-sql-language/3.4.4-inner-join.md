# 3.4.4: INNER JOIN

## Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT, category_id INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE categories (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
```

Create some records:

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('vegan');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('keto');
INSERT INTO categories (name) VALUES ('nut free');
```

Check which IDs have been assigned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```

Associate and create some recipes:

```sql
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Udon', 1);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Mee Pok', 2);
INSERT INTO recipes (label, category_id) VALUES ('Pasta', 1);
```

## INNER JOIN

Query that JOINs the two tables:

```sql
 SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id, categories.id, categories.name
 FROM recipes
 INNER JOIN categories
 ON categories.id = recipes.category_id;
```

An inner join is a query to find the overlapping values between two tables. This query is getting result rows when the category `id` is the same as the `category_id`.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/join-query.jpg)

The result of the query is to output a new table that has one row when two rows from the joined tables matched. \(`categories.id` is equal to`recipes.category_id`\).

Notice how the result of the query in psql is another table:

```text
 id |  label  | category_id | id | name
----+---------+-------------+----+-------
  1 | Udon    |           1 |  1 | vegan
  2 | Mee Pok |           2 |  2 | keto
  3 | Pasta   |           1 |  1 | vegan
```

Also note how row 1 in the categories table is duplicated on multiple rows in this new table.

### AS

We can change the column names of this result by using `AS`:

```sql
SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id AS recipe_category_id, categories.id AS category_id, categories.name
FROM recipes
INNER JOIN categories
ON categories.id = recipes.category_id;
```

```text
 id |  label  | recipe_category_id | category_id | name
----+---------+--------------------+-------------+-------
  1 | Udon    |                  1 |           1 | vegan
  2 | Mee Pok |                  2 |           2 | keto
  3 | Pasta   |                  1 |           1 | vegan
```

### WHERE

Almost all of our INNER JOIN queries will have a WHERE clause.

#### Get a list of recipes with the category name for each recipe for all the vegan recipes:

```sql
SELECT recipes.id, recipes.label, recipes.category_id AS recipe_category_id, categories.id AS category_id, categories.name
FROM recipes
INNER JOIN categories
ON categories.id = recipes.category_id
WHERE category_id=1;
```
