# 3.4.3: SQL Relationships \(Many to Many\)

## Introduction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/one-to-many.jpg)

We already saw relating two tables to each other using **foreign keys**. This creates a relationship in which one row in a table can be referenced multiple times in another table. This relationship is referred to as one-to-many.

Now we'll see a relationship that is two-way between two tables.

One initial thought you may have is that we can simply put another category id inside the category id cell. e.g., something like this:

```javascript

{
  "label": "Mee Pok",
  "category_id": [1,2]
}

```

But remember that a very rigid rule of SQL is that you should never put more than one piece of data in a cell. \(Later when we do represent these relationships in JavaScript we will want to create an object that is similar to above\).

The setup we need in order to accomplish this is actually to create a third table to hold only the relationship information. A row in this table will link together a row in one table to a row in another.

## Many-to-Many

We will redo our recipe app from before, but this one will encode the idea not only of a category having many recipes associated with it, but also that a recipe can be in more than category.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, label TEXT);

CREATE TABLE categories ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

CREATE TABLE recipe_categories ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, recipe_id INTEGER, category_id INTEGER);
```

### Create Categories

```sql
INSERT INTO categories ( name ) VALUES ('vegan');
INSERT INTO categories ( name ) VALUES ('keto');
INSERT INTO categories ( name ) VALUES ('nut free');
```

### Create Recipes

```sql
INSERT INTO recipes ( label, category_id ) VALUES ('Udon');
INSERT INTO recipes ( label, category_id ) VALUES ('Mee Pok');
INSERT INTO recipes ( label, category_id ) VALUES ('Pasta');
```

### Check IDs

```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
SELECT * FROM recipes;
```

### Create  Associations Between Recipes and Categories

Give Udon the vegan and keto category, and give Mee Pok the keto category.

```sql
INSERT INTO recipe_categories ( recipe_id, category_id ) VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO recipe_categories ( recipe_id, category_id ) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO recipe_categories ( recipe_id, category_id ) VALUES (2, 1);
```

### Get All Vegan Recipes

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_categories WHERE category_id=1;
```

### Get Udon Categories

```sql
SELECT * FROM recipe_categories WHERE recipe_id=1;
```
