# 3.6.1: Cookies

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzoW\_GO45vk" %}

Cookies are a browser-side feature that will hold onto data and send it in subsequent requests.

Cookies are one of the main technologies that enables basic functionalities like user login, and is one of the main ways that you are tracked across the internet for the purpose of ads, although that is currently changing, with laws and technical developments. See more about that below:

## Headers

Specifically cookies are keyed to specific response headers and request headers.

If the browser receives a properly formatted **response** header, it will store a given set of cookie data.

On every new subsequent **request** on the same domain,. it will send that data back in the header of the request.

#### Cookie Setting and Sending Order:

1. The browser receives a response back from the server. This response header has the `Set-Cookie` key in it. The `Set-Cookie` key's value is a set of keys and values that contain cookie data and metadata.
2. The browser stores that set of keys and values.
3. The browser makes another request to that domain. Inside the request headers are the cookie keys and values.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The most important part of this mechanic to understand is that the instruction to set the cookie is in the **response** header to a request.
{% endhint %}

## Incognito Mode

The defining characteristic of Incognito Mode is that its cookie environment is separate from the non-Incognito cookie environment \(i.e., cookies are not mixed between the two\).

Open Incognito mode and open the Dev Tools. Go to [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl) and look in the Network tab.

Look for the `Set-Cookie` header in the response. Look in the **request** header. It doesn't say anything about cookies.

Go to another Google domain address: [https://www.google.com/doodles/](https://www.google.com/doodles/)

Look in the **request** headers to see the cookies that the browser was previously instructed to hold, being sent back.

Look in the Application tab to see the set of all cookies for this domain. Click around the www.google.com domain to see that these cookies are being sent on every subsequent request.

## Curl

Send a cookie with `curl`.

```text
curl -v --cookie "TOKEN1=Yes;TOKEN2=no" http://localhost:3000/recipe/1
```

## Express

Create a GET route for each of the cookie actions below. Check the Chrome Dev Tools Application tab after each request.

### Response: Set a cookie

[http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html\#res.cookie](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.cookie)

```text
response.cookie('name', 'tobi');
response.cookie('weight', '230');
```

### Response: Delete a cookie

```text
response.clearCookie('name');
```

### Request: Receive a cookie

```text
console.log(request.headers);
console.log(request.headers.cookie);
```

Notice that the cookie value in the header is all the cookies together in a single string.

## Exercise

Go to the Application tab of the Chrome Dev Tools. Navigate to a website that you have a login for, and remember the password to.

Delete all the cookies for this domain to see that you get logged out.

Open an incognito tab and go to amazon.com. Add something to the shopping cart. 

Go to the Application tab of the Chrome Dev Tools. Delete all the cookies for amazon and refresh the page. Your cart will empty.

### Visit Counter

Set a cookie each time a user visits the URL /home.

```text
app.get('/home', ( request, response ) => {

    response.cookie('visits', 1);
    response.send('hello');
    
    resonse.send(`Current cookie value- visits:${visits}`);
});
```

In order to "count" the visits we'll increment the current value of the cookie for every request.

We need to install a library to parse the cookie value in the header into an object.

```text
npm install cookie-parser
```

This creates a cookie key inside of request.

```text
console.log(request.cookies.visits)
```

[http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html\#req.cookies](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.cookies)  
  
Change around the logic of the visits cookie so that the value increases.

```text
let visits = Number( request.cookies.visits ); // get the value from the request

// set a new value of the cookie
visits +=1;

response.cookie('visits', visits); // set a new value to send back

resonse.send(`Current cookie value- visits:${visits}`);
```
