# 3.1.2: HTML Forms

When [talking about the request behavior of HTML](../../2-back-end-basics/2.8-chrome-networking.md#html-tag-request-behavior) we said that a `form` element is one of the types of tags that creates requests.

In a web application a form is used to send a specific set of information to the server.

Note that there are other ways to send most of the data we'll be talking about \(like in the URL path\), but that the best practice is to send it via a form.

The most famous form is the search bar form on the [Google homepage.](https://google.com)

## Form Request

Render this HTML and click the submit button.

```markup
<form action="/hello">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```

The Chrome Dev tools display the parameters of the request in the request details.

## HTTP Method

The first thing we'll be using forms for are to create something that is permanently stored on the disk.

We'll use the form inputs to collect the data that will go into the JSON file.

POST is the designated HTTP method that signifies a request to store something. We can set the method of a form like this:

```markup
<form action="/hello" method="POST">
```

Make the above change to the form and see the request change. The heading containing the request parameters changes to Form Data. There are also no more query parameters in the URL.

Form data is a special kind of data sent in an HTTP request because it can contain data like files. This is the specific property that separates request data \(like an image to upload\) from request headers \(like the user agent\).

Notice the name attribute of the form is bold, and the information that was typed in is related to the name attribute.
