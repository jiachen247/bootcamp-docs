# 3.1.2: HTML Forms

When [talking about the request behavior of HTML](../../2-back-end-basics/2.8-chrome-networking.md#html-tag-request-behavior) we said that a `form` element is one of the types of tags that creates requests.

In a web application a form is used to send a specific set of information to the server.

Note that there are other ways to send most of the data we'll be talking about \(like in the URL path\), but that the best practice is to send it via a form.

The most famous form is the search bar form on the [google homepage.](https://google.com)

Form Request

```markup
<form action="/hello">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```
