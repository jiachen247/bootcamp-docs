# 3.PCE.7: Bird Watching Species

Add the species onto the app.

#### Species Table

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the species | Northern Pintail |
| scientific\_name | TEXT | Scientific Name of species | Anas acuta |

Refactor the app so that when a user creates a note they can [select from a list](../3.5-sql-applications/3.5.5-rendering-one-to-many-forms.md) which species the note is about.

Take a look at some species you can input manually to start:
