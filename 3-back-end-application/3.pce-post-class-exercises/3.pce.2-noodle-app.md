# 3.PCE.2: Noodle App

Completely re-create the HTML noodle app using Express.js and EJS.

Copy over the HTML and CSS you wrote in the [last exercise](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodle-app-css) and use it inside the EJS template.

For now you will have to copy the HTML boiler plate for each EJS file. \(We'll get rid of this inefficiency later\).

Render all the URLs in each recipe object. \(i.e., image URLs as images, other URLs as links\).

### Public

To be able to use CSS files, enable Express.js' built in file server:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

See more[ in the docs here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) and [full docs here.](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static)

Create a directory named `public`. All CSS files will go in this directory.

Make a request for a css file inside the directory to make sure that the configs work:

Place your `styles.css` file inside the `pubic` directory.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/styles.css
```

When you make a request to this URL you should see the contents of the file.

## Comfortable

### Category

On the home page, / make a list of links for all the categories.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/category/vegan
```

The above address shows a page that has a list of recipes.

## More Comfortable

### Order by / Sort by

Create a link for parameter to sort by \(yield, source, caution, category\) **and** a link for sort order, ascending and descending.
