# 3.PCE.8: Bird Watching Behaviour

## Introduction

We will add a many-to-many relationship between notes and bird behaviours to Bird Watcher. Please read [3.5.6: Forms for Many-to-Many Relationships](../3.5-sql-applications/3.5.6-forms-for-many-to-many-relationships.md) before working on this exercise.

## Base

Allow the user to add bird behaviours to notes when creating new notes. Seed the database with a few categories based on the below Bird Behaviour Bingo image such as bathing, resting and pecking. A note can have more than one behaviour associated with it, and vice versa. Do not create any new routes for this functionality.

## Comfortable

Create GET routes to retrieve behaviour data and notes on birds with specific behaviours.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /behaviours | GET | Render a list of behaviours |
| /behaviours/:id | GET | Render a behaviour. This has a list of all notes with this behaviour. |

## More Comfortable

Allow editing of behaviours in notes. This means when we render note pages, we render checkboxes that are checked according to the current values in the DB.
