# 3.PCE.8: Bird Watching Behaviour



![](../../.gitbook/assets/bird-behavior-bingo-smallerjpg.jpg)

## Base

When a note gets created add on the behaviours you observed the bird make.

Seed the database with a few behaviours based on this image such as bathing, resting, pecking. A note can have more than one behaviour associated with it.

Do not create any new routes for this functionality.

## Comfortable

Create GET routes to retrieve behaviour data and notes on birds with specific behaviours.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /behaviours | GET | Render a list of behaviours |
| /behaviours/:id | GET | Render a behaviour. This has a list of all notes with this behaviour. |

## More Comfortable

Allow editing of behaviours in notes. This means when we render note pages, we render checkboxes that are checked according to the current values in the DB.
