# 3.PCE.9: Bird Watching Comments

Add commenting on to the bird watching notes.

Any user can log in to the app and leave a comment on another user's note.

Create GET routes to retrieve behaviour data and notes on birds with specific behaviours.

#### Routes

On an individual note page render a form to create a new comment. Use the url path parameter \(`:id` as in the route above\) to set the comment's note `id` in the form.

Use the user's ID set in a cookie to set the comment's user ID.
