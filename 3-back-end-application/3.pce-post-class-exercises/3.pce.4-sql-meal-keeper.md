# 3.PCE.4: SQL Meal Keeper

## Base

Create a command line app that will keep track of meals that you've eaten.

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | id | 1 |
| meal\_time | TEXT | The time the meal was eaten. | breakfast, lunch |
| description | TEXT | Description of what was eaten. | Mc Donalds and KFC |
| alcohol | INTEGER | Unit amount of alcohol consumed with meal. | 3 |
| hungry | BOOLEAN | Was feeling hungry before eating or not. | true |

Write a CREATE TABLE statement based on the information above and run it on your database.

### Enter a meal

```text
node index.js breakfast 'nasi lemak' 0 true
```

### See your meals so far

```text
node index.js report
```

## Comfortable

### Update

When the report prints out, allow the user to edit a meal.

```text
node index.js report
```

```text
1 breakfast - nasi lemak - no alcohol - feeling hungry
2 lunch - burrito - 1 unit of alcohol - feeling hungry
```

```text
node index.js edit 1 meal_time supper
```

### Report

Allow the user to make more fine-grained reports below.

```text
node index.js report breakfast
```

```text
node index.js report hungry
```

```text
node index.js report not-hungry
```

## More Comfortable

### created\_at

Look up the Postgres Date type in the [docs](https://node-postgres.com/features/types#date--timestamp--timestamptz). Change the table to add another column called `created_at`.

### Reports

Add some more detailed reports.

```text
node index.js report drink
```

Give statistics on how often \(as a ratio\) the user consumes alcohol at meal time.

Give statistics on what the average units per meal is.

Do these calculations in JavaScript.

Using the `created_at` column, get a list of all meals since the week began.

```text
node index.js report week-so-far
```

Using the `created_at` column, get a list of the meals in the last seven days not including today.

```text
node index.js report last-week
```

### Deploy

Deploy the app into a new instance of EC2. \(You will have to install Postgres on the instance\). Download an [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-ssh-client/id549039908) or [Andriod](https://termux.com/) app to be able to access the app via ssh.
