# 3.PCE.6: Bird Watching Users

Begin by making a branch to record the last state of your old set of code [in the previous repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/birding-express-swe1) Start this exercise by adding onto the main branch.

## Base

### Users

Implement the basic user login [described in 3.6.2.](../3.6-authentication/3.6.2-user-auth.md)

When the user logs in, set their user id in a cookie.

### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /signup | GET | Render a form that will sign up a user. |
| /signup | POST | Accept a POST request to create a user. |
| /login | GET | Render a form that will log a user in. |
| /login | POST | Accept a POST request to log a user in. |
| /logout | DELETE | Log a user out. Get rid of their cookie. |

### Create Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT, password TEXT);
```

## User Notes

Alter the notes table so that a note is created by a logged in user.

When you accept the POST request to create a note use the user id in the cookie to associate the new note with the logged in user.

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /note | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new sighting. |

## Comfortable

### Index

List the user name as part of the list of notes.

### User Pages

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /users/:id | GET | A list of all notes made by this user. |

### More Comfortable

### Edit

Implement editing and only allow the owner of the note to edit or delete it.
