# 3.PCE.1: Express Noodle App

Start with this repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodles-express-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodles-express-swe1)

Express.js is already listed as a dependency of the project. After you fork and clone the repo, do `npm install` to get Express.js.

Create a noodle app using the [data.json](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodles-express-swe1/blob/main/data.json) file included with this repo. It contains a premade list of recipes.

## Base

### Get By Index

This app will begin with one route:

```text
/recipe/:index
```

A request to this route will give back a raw JSON object with all the recipe data in it.

A request to:

```text
http://localhost:3004/recipe/0
```

Will send back:

```javascript
{
  "source": "BBC Good Food",
  "label": "Udon noodle soup",
  "url": "http://www.edamam.com/recipe/udon-noodle-soup-bf283c727cd11fb8ce42b98f09dabbac/noodle",
  "ingredients": "1 vegetable stock cube\n50ml teriyaki sauce\n1 tbsp vegetable oil\n140g chestnut mushroom, sliced\nÂ½ bunch spring onions, thinly sliced\n140g udon noodle\n200g bag spinach",
  "yield": 4,
  "caution": "Sulfites",
  "image": "https://www.edamam.com/web-img/7b2/7b24a14c8756cc1db75eb216fb593e6d.jpg",
  "category": "Vegan"
}
```

### Response Check

The HTTP protocol says that if something is not found, the response status code needs to be 404.

Detect that the `index` param is requesting for something that does not exist and send back the 404 status code and a message.

You can set the status and send the response in one line:

```javascript
res.status(404).send('Sorry, we cannot find that!');
```

## Comfortable

### Yield

Create a route that sends back a list of recipes if it matches the yield number.

This request sends back a list of recipes that yield 1.

```text
http://localhost:3004/yield/1
```

## More Comfortable

### Label

For SEO reasons you want a route that has the label of the recipe in it:

```text
http://localhost:3004/recipe-label/udon-noodle-soup
```

Notice that if the label has multiple words in it, it is represented in the URL with lowercase kebab-case.
