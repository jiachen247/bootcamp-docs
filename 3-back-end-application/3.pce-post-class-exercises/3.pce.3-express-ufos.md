# 3.PCE.3: Express - UFOs

Create an app that tracks UFO sightings.

Begin by forking and cloning [this repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ufo-express-swe1)

## Base

This app will render EJS files on the browser. Use Bootstrap to style the pages. Make the pages responsive so that they also don't look bad on a desktop width as well.

Here is a complete list of all the routes that are spec'd out for this app.

Work on them in the order listed below.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /sighting | GET | Render a form that will create a new sighting. |
| /sighting | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new sighting. |
| /sighting/:index | GET | Render a single sighting. |
| / | GET | Render a list of sightings. |
| /sighting/:index/edit | GET | Render a form to edit a sighting. |
| /sighting/:index/edit | PUT | Accept a request to edit a single sighting |
| /sighting/:index/delete | DELETE | Accept a request to delete a sighting. |
| /shapes | GET | Render a list of sighting shapes. |
| /shapes/:shape | GET | Render a list of sightings that has one shape. |

_Note: notice that there is no GET route involving DELETE. The delete form is integrated into the root_ `/` _route. At each row of the list of sightings is a form with a single button that deletes that sighting._

## Comfortable

For the creation and edit of the sighting, implement functions that check the input from the user. Write them so that they can be reused for creation and edit.

## More Comfortable

If an input validation fails, use the [Bootstrap form validation styles](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/#validation) to let the user know what they did wrong. \(Note- DO NOT use the JavaScript validation- just use the CSS class validation\).
