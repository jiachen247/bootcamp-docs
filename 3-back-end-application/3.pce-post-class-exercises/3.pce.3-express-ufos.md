# 3.PCE.3: Express - UFOs

Create an app that tracks UFO sightings.

Begin by forking and cloning [this repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ufo-express-swe1)

## Base

This app will render EJS files on the browser. Use Bootstrap to style the pages. Make the pages responsive so that they also don't look bad on a desktop width as well.

Here is a complete list of all the routes that are spec'd out for this app.

Work on them in the order listed below.

### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /sighting | GET | Render a form that will create a new sighting. |
| /sighting | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new sighting. |
| /sighting/:index | GET | Render a single sighting. |
| / | GET | Render a list of sightings. |
| /sighting/:index/edit | GET | Render a form to edit a sighting. |
| /sighting/:index/edit | PUT | Accept a request to edit a single sighting |
| /sighting/:index/delete | DELETE | Accept a request to delete a sighting. |
| /shapes | GET | Render a list of sighting shapes. |
| /shapes/:shape | GET | Render a list of sightings that has one shape. |

_Note: notice that there is no GET route involving DELETE. The delete form is integrated into the root_ `/` _route. At each row of the list of sightings is a form with a single button that deletes that sighting._

## Comfortable

### Date Created

Use the [JavaScript Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to add a standardized time and date for when the sighting was submitted \(note that this is different from the reported time of the sighting\).

### Validation

For the creation and editing of sightings, implement functions that check the input from the user. Write them so that they can be reused for creation and editing.

{% hint style="info" %}
The validation we are performing in Module 3 is all server-side validation, meaning the validation happens within the server. In Module 4 we will learn about client-side validation, where we can validate form values client-side before they are sent to the server.
{% endhint %}

## More Comfortable

### Bootstrap Validation

If an input validation fails, use the [Bootstrap form validation styles](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/#validation) to let the user know what they did wrong. \(Note- DO NOT use the JavaScript validation- just use the CSS class validation\).

### jsonFileStorage

Abstract away each HTTP method action into the JSON file storage module. \(GET and POST are already done\).

**GET** read

**POST** add

**PUT** edit

**DELETE** delete

### Date Validation

Make sure the user can't submit a sighting on a date in the future.

### Date Format

Install the [moment npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) package and use it to format the date the sighting was submitted in the format "_x_ days ago".

[https://momentjs.com/docs/\#/displaying/fromnow/](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)

Use the library to nicely format the sighting date, e.g., "Monday, September 12th, 1997".

### Visit Counter

Add a visit counter for the home page of the site.

This is a count of all the people that have visited the site. \(You can test this by opening and closing an incognito window - when all incognito windows close, the cookies get erased\).

Display the counter on the home page.

### Visit Counter 2

A visit counts for a given user only once a day and for any page on the site \(i.e., a visit is when they go to any page on the site\). Visits on the same day do not increment the visit counter.

### Deployment

Spin up a new AWS instance and deploy the app.

### Favorites

Allow the user to submit "favorite" sightings. Save this information of the list of sightings for them in a cookie. Display the information in the cookie back out to them when viewing the home page. This should be a list of links to the sightings.
