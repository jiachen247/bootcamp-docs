# 3.PCE.5: Bird Watching

Create an app for bird watching field notes.

Begin by forking and cloning [this repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/birding-express-swe1)

According to [this website a bird watching](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-keep-a-birding-journal-386691) **note** should consist of the following: 

```text
Habitat:

Note plant life, water sources and vegetation conditions, as well as which of the plants the bird is preferring as you observe it.

Date:

Record the date, time and day of the week you are making the observation, as well as how long you were able to see the bird and whether or not you had clear views or just intermittent glimpses.

Appearance:

Take copious notes on the bird's appearance, including the brilliance of plumage, any peculiar markings and any outstanding or unusual features such as missing feathers, leucistic patches or signs of illness. Record the bird's gender if possible.

Behavior:

Take notes on what the bird was doing as you observed it. Note general actions and specific reactions to changing conditions, such as the appearance of a predator or how the bird interacts with other birds. Note large actions such as preening, flight patterns, and foraging habits as well as small movements such as tail bobs, head cocks or wing stretches.

Vocalizations:

If the bird sang or made other sounds during your observation, use mnemonics or descriptions of how it sounded. Note non-vocal sounds such as wing noises or drumming.

Flock Size:

If you are observing more than one bird at a time, try to estimate how many birds are in the flock. Also, try to note how genders are balanced if possible, and check different birds to see if they are the same species or part of a mixed flock.
```

You don't have to include all of this information. Date, behavior, and flock size are sufficient. We will be adding things like species and weather later.

## Base

This app will render EJS files on the browser. Use Bootstrap to style the pages. Make the pages responsive so that they also don't look bad on a desktop width as well.

Begin this app with just three routes for the bird watching notes:

Work on them in the order listed below.

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /note | GET | Render a form that will create a new sighting. |
| /note | POST | Accept a POST request to create a new sighting. |
| /note/:id | GET | Render a single sighting. |
| / | GET | Render a list of sightings. |

Create a database for this app called birding.

Create a single table called `notes` and columns based on the info above.

Notice that the name of the parameter of a single note has changed from `index` to `id`. We are now referencing the _**serial primary key**_ of the `notes` table that will be called `id`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Completeness of all parts of this app is not the point of this set of exercises, so don't worry too much about completing everything for the bird watching notes. In the next set of exercises we will be adding relationships to the app.
{% endhint %}

## Comfortable

#### Routes

| URL Path | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| /note/:id/edit | GET | Render a form to edit a sighting. |
| /note/:id/edit | PUT | Accept a request to edit a single sighting |
| /note/:id/delete | DELETE | Accept a request to delete a sighting. |

## More Comfortable

Implement sorting of the list on the index page.
