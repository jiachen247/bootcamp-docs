# 3.6.3: Password Hashing

## Introduction

It is bad security practice to save plain-text passwords in the database. If the database were to get hacked, hackers would get access to everyone's passwords. Instead we'll implement a system to verify passwords by keeping a _proxy value_ in the database that is not the original password. We will do this with a **cryptographic hash algorithm**.

## Hash Algorithms are Consistent

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) a cryptographic hash is "a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size". In other words, a hash function takes a string and irreversibly translates it into another string.

The most important aspect of this transformation is that **for a given input string, e.g. "hello", the same value will always be output**, e.g. "xyz123". We can rely on the fact that when we put "hello" into the function, "xyz123" will always be the output.

## Hash Output has Consistent Length

To help obfuscate the value of the input to the hash algorithm, **hash output is always the same length, no matter what the length or size of the input**.

In our examples we use the [SHA512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash algorithm, which always outputs a message that is 512 bits in size. We can format this output in different ways, but we'll be outputting a hexadecimal number and saving it as a string.

## Hash Output is Not Related to Hash Input

**A small change in the input creates a big change in the output**. For example, SHA512 hash input "a" generates the following output.

```javascript
1f40fc92da241694750979ee6cf582f2d5d7d28e18335de05abc54d0560e0f5302860c652bf08d560252aa5e74210546f369fbbbce8c12cfc7957b2652fe9a75
```

Hash string "A" generates the following output.

```javascript
21b4f4bd9e64ed355c3eb676a28ebedaf6d8f17bdc365995b319097153044080516bd083bfcce66121a3072646994c8430cc382b8dc543e84880183bf856cff5
```

Note that the two outputs look completely different. We cannot tell what the input is by looking at the output. The hash obfuscates the original input, and it is mathematically difficult to take the output value and recreate the input value.

## Hash Outputs Rarely Repeat for Different Inputs

In hash algorithms, different inputs generating the same output is called a "collision". SHA512 has the ability to convert large inputs into 512-bit outputs, thereby "losing" information, increasing chances of a collision. Fortunately for algorithms such as SHA512, **the chances of a collision are sufficiently small.**

The creators of hash algorithms mathematically verify the probability of two values producing the same output, minimising that probability as much as possible. Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4014090/is-it-safe-to-ignore-the-possibility-of-sha-collisions-in-practice).

## jsSHA

`jssha` is a JavaScript implementation of SHA hash algorithms. Install `jssha` with NPM.

```javascript
npm install jssha
```

Here is an example of how jsSHA can be used.

```javascript
import jsSHA from "jssha";

const shaObj = new jsSHA("SHA-512", "TEXT", { encoding: "UTF8" });
shaObj.update("Text to hash.");
const hash = shaObj.getHash("HEX");

console.log("hashed text");
console.log(hash);
```

## User Auth

We'll use this hash function in two places.

#### When the user registers.

When the user registers instead of permanently recording their password in the database we will create a hash of the password and store that instead and discard the password itself.

```javascript
app.post('/signup', (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');
  
  const shaObj = new jsSHA("SHA-512", "TEXT", { encoding: "UTF8" });
  
  // input the value from the request
  shaObj.update(request.body.password);
  
  // get the value out
  const hashedPassword = shaObj.getHash("HEX");
    
  const values = [request.body.email, hashedPassword];

  pool.query('INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES ($1, $2)', values, (error, result) => {
    // ...
```

#### When the user logs in.

When the user logs in we'll hash the incoming value.

If the hashed value is the same as the value in the database, it's the same value as the one the user originally entered, so we have verified this user.

Starting on line 22 we added the login password hashing code.

```javascript
app.post('/login', (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');

  const values = [request.body.email];

  pool.query('SELECT * from users WHERE email=$1', values, (error, result) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('Error executing query', error.stack);
      response.status(503).send(result.rows);
      return;
    }

    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      // we didnt find a user with that email.
      // the error for password and user are the same. don't tell the user which error they got for security reasons, otherwise people can guess if a person is a user of a given service.
      response.status(403).send('sorry!');
      return;
    }

    const user = result.rows[0];

    const shaObj = new jsSHA("SHA-512", "TEXT", { encoding: "UTF8" });
    
    // input the value from the request
    shaObj.update(request.body.password);
    
    // get the value out
    const hashedPassword = shaObj.getHash("HEX");

    if (user.password === hashedPassword) {
      response.cookie('loggedIn', true);
      response.send('logged in!');
    } else {
      // password didn't match
      // the error for password and user are the same. don't tell the user which error they got for security reasons, otherwise people can guess if a person is a user of a given service.
      response.status(403).send("sorry!");
    }
  });
});
```
