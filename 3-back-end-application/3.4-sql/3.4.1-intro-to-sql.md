# 3.4.1: Basic SQL Commands

For this exercise we'll use this [implementation of a SQL database](https://sql.js.org/examples/GUI/). It comes from a full JavaScript SQL database project you can read more about [here.](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js)

Note that this implementation assumes an already created database.

Paste each line in and run it. In order to see the effects of the queries you'll have to run another SELECT statement.

#### CREATE TABLE

Notice that we are specifying the data type of the columns here. We'll specify all the possible data types later.

```text
CREATE TABLE cats (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    weight INTEGER
);
```

#### INSERT

Note that we are not specifying the id column in the INSERT statement.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Mr. Snuggles', 'Calico', 327);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Jake AlPurrrrtsen', 'Bambino', 424);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Furry Mc Furmeister', 'Persian', 512);
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Kai', 'LaPerm', 387);
```

#### Primary Key

In this course, for every table, we'll be naming a column called id. A feature of SQL systems is that we can have an auto-incrementing column that give an automatic and guaranteed unique number for every row created. 

#### SELECT

Get the name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT name FROM cats;
```

Get the id and name column from all rows.

```text
SELECT id,name FROM cats;
```

Get the same columns in a different order.

```text
SELECT name,id FROM cats;
```

Get all rows from all columns of this table. 

```text
SELECT * FROM cats;
```

#### SELECT WHERE

```text
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id=1;
```

#### SELECT WHERE logical operators

Get all cats with id less than 3.

```text
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id<3;
```

#### SELECT WHERE AND OR

Get all cats with id more than 2 and weight less than 300.

```text
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id>2 AND weight < 300;
```

#### UPDATE

```text
UPDATE cats SET name = 'Susan Chan' WHERE id=2;
```

#### DELETE

```text
DELETE FROM cats WHERE id=2;
```

Note that a property of the unique `id` column is that if there is another insert query, the `id`s do not rearrange. Try this out by making a new `INSERT` query.

```text
INSERT INTO cats (name, type, weight) VALUES ('Chubby Pants', 'Calico', 433);
```

#### SELECT ORDER BY

```text
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY name ASC;
```

```text
SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY name DESC;
```

#### SELECT COUNT

Count the number or rows in a whole table.

```text
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM cats;
```

Give a where clause.

```text
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM cats WHERE weight > 400;
```
