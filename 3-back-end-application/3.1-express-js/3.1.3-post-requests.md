# 3.1.3: POST Requests

## Introduction

![POST request parameters are sent in a request section called the &quot;body&quot;.](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-11-12-at-8.28.43-pm.png)

## Receive POST Request Data as Keys and Values

Our form request doesn't work yet because we did not set a route to listen for it.

We can set a route to listen for this request and get a hold of the POST form data. Notice that the data above has keys and values.

The key is the `name` attribute of the form `input` tag:

```markup
<input type="text" id="label" name="label" value="chicken udon">
```

When this requests gets to our route callback, it'll be an object with these keys and values.

To receive POST request data as an object we need one piece of configuration:

```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

See the full docs for[ urlencoded here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded).

The object with the form request data is called `body`.

```javascript
app.post('/recipe', (request, response) => {
  console.log('request body:', request.body);
  response.send('we saved your recipe');
});
```

Change the name attribute of one of the form input elements and watch the keys of the object change.

## Store POST Request Data in JSON

We'll take this incoming object and store it in the data.json file.

### views/recipe.ejs

```markup
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="/recipe" method="POST">
      <label for="label">recipe label:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="label" name="label" /><br />
      <label for="ingredients">ingredients:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="ingredients" name="ingredients" /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

### data.json

```javascript
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "label": "banana shake",
      "ingredients": "bananas"
    }
  ]
}
```

### index.js

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

import { add } from './jsonFileStorage.js';

const PORT = 3004;

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// config to accept request form data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// app.post - accept form request
app.post('/recipe', (request, response) => {
  console.log('request body', request.body);

  // add an element to the array
  add('data.json', 'recipes', request.body, (data, error) => {
    // check for errors
    if (error) {
      response.status(500).send('sorry this didnt work');
      return;
    }

    // send back an acknowledgement
    response.send('done!');
  });
});

// render the form that will create the request
app.get('/recipe', (request, response) => {
  response.render('recipe');
});

app.listen(PORT);
```

Note the hierarchical nature of the app functions and the route matching. There are two path matchers with `/recipe` but they don't interfere with each other because they are meant for different methods.

## Exercise

Repeat the above code.

Change the `name` attribute of one of the form `input`s to see what happens.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, after form submit, if we press the refresh button in Chrome, Chrome will replay the request and thus submit the form again. This is why many applications ask us not to refresh the page on sensitive submit pages such as for payments.

To avoid this behaviour we can redirect to a new page after form submit.
{% endhint %}
