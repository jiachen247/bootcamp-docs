# 3.ICE.3: Bigfoot POST

## Base

Save a Bigfoot sighting in your app. Create the functionality in the app for adding things into the JSON file in the order listed below \(this is also the order you should build in any other app\).

### Forms

Start by creating a form that creates a POST request. To begin with don't worry about including all of the Bigfoot sighting fields. Begin with just YEAR and SEASON.

Confirm that the form is producing a well formed request, with the appropriate keys and values by checking it in the Chrome Dev tools.

### Curl

Generate an equivalent POST request using curl:

```text
curl -d "YEAR=1989&SEASON=spring" -X POST http://localhost:3004/sighting
```

### app.post

Create the listener for the request. Remember to include the configuration for [request.body](../3.1-intro-to-express-js/3.1.3-post-request.body.md#keys-and-values). Begin with just a `console.log` to confirm that you are receiving the request correctly:

```javascript
console.log(request.body);
response.send('it worked!');
```

Run the above `curl` command to confirm that the request is received properly.

Run the command again with different parameters to see them in request.body:

```text
curl -d "YEAR=9999999&SEASON=pepper" -X POST http://localhost:3004/sighting
```

### JSON

Use the `jsonFileStorage` `add` function to store the request.

## Comfortable

### Full Params

Add the rest of the params to the form.

### Redirect

The normal behavior for an app when the request was saved, is to show the current thing \(the sighting\). The easiest way we can do that is to **redirect** the user to the correct page:

```markup
http://localhost:3004/sighting/<INDEX>
```

Take a look at the Express.js docs for redirect here: [https://expressjs.com/en/api.html\#res.redirect](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.redirect)

## More Comfortable

### Sort Form

Create a form that duplicates the query parameter request from the [previous sort exercise.](3.ice.1-bigfoot.md#sort-by)

Create a form that produces this request:

```text
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings?sort=asc
http://localhost:3004/year-sightings?sort=desc
```

Remember that by default, a form produces a GET request with query parameters.

Use an HTML `select` tag in the form that allows the user to select the sort parameter \(in this case, `asc` and `desc`\) from the dropdown.

You can also add a similar dropdown for [the other sort option:](3.ice.2-bigfoot-ejs.md#sort-by)

```markup
http://localhost:3004/?sortby=year
http://localhost:3004/?sortby=state
```
