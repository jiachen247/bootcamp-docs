# 3.ICE.6: One to Many

Create a command line app that tracks cats and owners.

Begin with [the base node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Install the pg library.

```text
npm install pg
```

This exercise will be similar to the [command line app in 3.PCE.5](../3.pce-post-class-exercises/3.pce.5-bird-watching.md). Use the template below to begin.

#### index.js

```javascript
import pg from 'pg';
const { Client } = pg;

// set the way we will connect to the server
const pgConnectionConfigs = {
  user: '<MY_UNIX_USERNAME>',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: '<MY_UNIX_USERNAME>',
  port: 5432, // Postgres server always runs on this port
};

// create the var we'll use
const client = new Client(pgConnectionConfigs);

// make the connection to the server
client.connect();

// create the query done callback
const whenQueryDone = (error, result) => {
  // this error is anything that goes wrong with the query
  if (error) {
    console.log('error', error);
  } else {
    // rows key has the data
    console.log(result.rows);
  }

  // close the connection
  client.end();
};

// write the SQL query
const sqlQuery = 'SELECT * from cats';

// run the SQL query
client.query(sqlQuery, whenQueryDone);
```

## Base

Create a new database called **vet**.

Record the CREATE TABLE statements in a separate file in the repo. Create both of the tables specified below.

Owners have many cats and cats belong to an owner.

#### Cats Table

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | id | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the cat. | Alex |
| owner\_id | INTEGER | id of the owner | 1 |

#### Owners Table

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | id | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the owner. | Kai |

## Examples

#### INSERT

Create a cat owner.

```text
node index.js create-owner Jim
```

```text
node index.js create-owner <OWNER_NAME>
```

Create a cat and associate an owner

```text
node index.js create-cat 1 Fluffy
```

```text
node index.js create-cat <OWNER_ID> <CAT_NAME>
```

#### SELECT

For these queries you will have to do two sequential queries- That is to say that you will have a nested SQL query. [Refer to 3.5.3 here.](../3.5-sql-applications/3.5.3-nested-sql-queries.md)

Get a list of cats.

```text
node index.js cats
```

```text
Cats:
1. Fluffy : Owner: Jim
2. Cathy : Owner: Jim
```

Get a list of owners.

```text
node index.js owners
```

```text
Owners:
1. Jim
    - Cats:
        - Fluffy
        - Furr Furr
2. Cathy
    - Cats:
        - Gordon
        - Susan Chan
```

## Comfortable

Create a cat using the owner's name, instead of their id.

```text
node index.js create-cat Jim Gordon 
```

```text
node index.js create-cat <OWNER_NAME> <CAT_NAME>
```

## More Comfortable

Get some data out of the database. For some of these you can simply do calculations in JavaScript instead of writing SQL. You should not need any SQL queries we did not already cover.

#### Amount of Cats

Add an optional argument to owners. Get all the owners with 3 cats.

```text
node index.js owners 3
```

#### Logical Amount of Cats

Get all the owners with more than three cats.

```text
node index.js owners >3
```

Get all the owners with less than three cats.

```text
node index.js owners <3
```

#### Cat Siblings

Get all list of cats that Fluffy's owner owns.

```text
node index.js other-cats Fluffy
```

```text
node index.js other-cats <CAT_NAME>
```
