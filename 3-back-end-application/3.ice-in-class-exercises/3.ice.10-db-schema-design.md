# 3.ICE.10: DB Schema Design



### DB Setup

1. Create a new database called `carousell`. 

### ERD

Create a DB schema for Carousell.

Do this exercise in stages. Think about what the core functionality of the app is, so that you can begin with only the bare essential pieces of data. \(In any large app the real database will have many, many tables- the point of this exercise is not completeness so don't worry about including everything\).

IF you finish with this base level of the app, go back and add other features and details.

Write an ERD for the database, naming the types of data and their relationships.

After this is done, if it is helpful you can add the table column names to the ERD.

### `CREATE TABLE` SQL

Record the `CREATE TABLE` statements in a file `init_tables.sql` . 

Begin by writing the SQL statements to create all the tables specified in the ERD.

### `INSERT` SQL

Record the `INSERT` statements in a file `seed.sql` . 

Write some SQL to insert dummy data into the tables

### `SELECT` SQL

Record the `SELECT` statements in a file `queries.sql` . 

Unlike previous exercises, write sample SELECT queries that you think would need to run on a given page \(for example this page: [https://www.carousell.sg/categories/furniture-13/shelves-and-drawers-1288](https://www.carousell.sg/categories/furniture-13/shelves-and-drawers-1288)\). 

Don't worry about INSERT or UPDATE queries.

Don't worry about things like queries for searches.
