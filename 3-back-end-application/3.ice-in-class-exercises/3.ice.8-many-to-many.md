# 3.ICE.8: Many to Many

## Base

Create a command line app to record your workouts.

### Set Up Database Schema

Create a new database and the following tables inside that database.

#### Exercise Table \(`exercises`\)

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the exercise | Pull up |

#### Workout Table \(`workouts`\)

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| name | TEXT | Name of the workout | Leg Tuesday |
| date | TEXT | Date of the workout | 3/3/2020 |

#### Join Table \(`exercise_workouts`\)

| column name | data type | description | example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | SERIAL PRIMARY KEY | ID | 1 |
| exercise\_id | INTEGER | ID of the exercise | 1 |
| workout\_id | INTEGER | ID of the workout | 1 |

### Insert Seed Data

Insert some exercises into the `exercises` table. Find a list of exercises [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_weight_training_exercises).

### Output Exercises

```text
node index.js exercises
```

Output:

```text
1. deadlift
2. squat
```

### Create Workouts \(With Existing Exercises\)

Add functionality so that when the user enters a new workout in the `workouts` table that includes exercises, they add also add the corresponding rows in the `exercise_workouts` table to associate the workout with exercises.

```
node index.js add-workout 'leg tuesday' '3/2/2020' 1 2
```

```text
node index.js add-workout <WORKOUT_NAME> <DATE> <EXERCISE_ID_1> <EXERCISE_ID_2> ...
```

When this command runs it will take each input after the 5th input \(after &lt;DATE&gt;\) and assume that it is an ID of an exercise. For each of these IDs it will create a row in the `exercise_workouts` table. 

### Get Workouts with Specific Exercise with Exercise ID

Use `exercise_id` to get all workouts with that exercise. Make an `INNER JOIN` query to list out workouts with this exercise. Join on the `workouts` and `exercise_workouts` tables.

```text
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise 2
```

```text
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise <EXERCISE_ID>
```

## Comfortable

### Get Workouts with Specific Exercise with Exercise Name

Use exercise name to get workouts instead of exercise ID. Make an `INNER JOIN` query to list out workouts with this exercise. Join on the `workouts` and `exercise_workouts` tables.

```text
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise squat
```

```text
node index.js get-workouts-by-exercise <EXERCISE_NAME>
```

### Save Workouts with Exercise Name

Do a nested query so that the user can save workout exercises by exercise name.

```text
node index.js add-workout 'leg tuesday' '3/2/2020' deadlift squat
```

```text
node index.js add-workout <WORKOUT_NAME> <DATE> <EXERCISE_NAME> <EXERCISE_NAME> ...
```

## More Comfortable

### Add Muscles Table

Add another table `muscles` that gives body part categories to each exercise, like in the table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_weight_training_exercises#Overview). An exercise will be associated with 1 or more muscles. Seed the `muscles` table with some muscles.

### Get Exercise by Muscle

Add a command that lists exercises by muscle name.

```text
node index.js get-exercise quads
```

```text
node index.js get-exercise <MUSCLE_NAME>
```

### Get Workout by Muscle

Add a command that lists workouts by muscle name.

```text
node index.js get-workout-by-muscle quads
```

```text
node index.js get-workout-by-muscle <MUSCLE_NAME>
```
