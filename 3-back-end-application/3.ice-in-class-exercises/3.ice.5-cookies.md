## Base

### Incognito

Open an incognito window and visit a popular website. What cookies are being set?

Close the window and open a new one and visit a different site. Are any cookies the same? Or different?

## Favorite

Add favorite to the recipes app.

Add a link on the recipe page /recipe/:index that takes the user to /favorites. Pass a query parameter to the server that says which recipe is being "favorited".

When this request is received, send back a Set-Cookie with the value of the recipe index inside. Redirect the user back to the original recipe page.

When the user visits the home page \("/" route\), use the value inside the cookie to display the user's favorite recipe.

## Comfortable

### Favorites

The user can have a list of favorites. The data that is saved in the cookie must be a string, but it must be structured. You can use JSON for this. Anytime the user clicks the link, add the recipe to the list of recipes.

## More Comfortable

### Favorite List Management

Give the user the ability to clear his entire list of favorites by erasing the cookie.
