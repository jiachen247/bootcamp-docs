# 5.0: Module 5 Overview

## **Full Stack App - Front-End Logic**

We'll enhance the functionality of our app by adding front-end JS back into our stack.

Bringing logic onto the browser means that we can build more interactive versions of our server-side apps. We can build UIs that are more "modern" and aren't just limited to the functionality provided to us by HTML elements. \(Remember that the only actions the user can take to affect our app data is to make a browser request- one that must be created by some HTML element- a form or link tag\).

This means that by adding front-end JavaScript we are making a trade-off by increasing the complexity of our app code, yet also increasing  usability. These are some of the design and engineering considerations when thinking about which features of a system to implement on the server or on the browser.
