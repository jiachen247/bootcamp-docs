## Comfortable

#### Refresh with Login

When the page loads, use JavaScript to check if the user is currently logged in. The browser JavaScript has access the the current set of cookies.

Use the cookie values to make a request to the server to verify that these cookies are authentic. If they are, the user is logged in.

#### Check Email

When the user clicks the submit button to register, make an ajax request to see if the email they entered is unique in the system.
