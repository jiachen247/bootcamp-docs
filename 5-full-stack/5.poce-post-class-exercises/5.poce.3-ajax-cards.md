## Game Play

![\(Create Game button not shown\)](../../.gitbook/assets/img_3904909d43e5-1.jpeg)

When a user clicks the "_Start Game_" button the app creates a game record and auto adds a second player into the game.

When either player clicks the "_Deal_" button, the app deals the cards to the player and evaluates who has won that hand. The result is recorded in the database and the response is sent back to the user.

At any time any of the users in the game can click a "_Refresh_" button to see the current status of the game.

## Comfortable

#### Score

Keep a running score of which user is winning the game.

#### Winner

The winner of the entire game is the player who gets 3 winning hands. Make a migration to the database to record the winner of the game. The game is over and can no longer be played.

## More Comfortable

#### Discards

When the user deals, allow them to specify how many cards get discarded before their card. This applies to both users. Show the users their discarded cards.

#### Winner records

Create an ejs page in express that displays the users winning and losing games.
