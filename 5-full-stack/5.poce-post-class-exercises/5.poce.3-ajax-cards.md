## Game Play

![](../../.gitbook/assets/img_3904909d43e5-1.jpeg)

When a user clicks the "_Start Game_" button the app creates a game record and auto adds a second player into the game.

When either player clicks the "_Deal_" button, the app deals the cards to the player and evaluates who has won that hand. The result is recorded in the database and the response is sent back to the user.

At any time any of the users in the game can click a "_Refresh_" button to see the current status of the game.
