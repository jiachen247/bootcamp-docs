# 5.2.2: AJAX Cards

Play a game of cards with the server.

### SWE101 Cards

In SWE101 we played a game of cards, where, when the user refreshed the page, the game disappeared forever. If the user wanted to they could open the console and cheat by looking at the deck variable.

We can use the database and server to fix these problems. We can store the state of the game on the server, and also make sure the user can't cheat by keeping the deck secret from them.

## `cards-ajax-swe1`

We'll begin by discussing the starter code repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1)

### Migration 

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/migrations/20201221183525-create-games-table.js\#L12](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/migrations/20201221183525-create-games-table.js#L12)

This repo uses a new column data type, JSON. \(This data type is not specific to Sequelize\). We can use this to break the rule of not storing more than one piece of data in a cell. This is for a few reasons:

1. We want to store data regarding a deck of cards. Using JSON it will be easy to store the entire deck data structure in a table cell.
2. Our deck data is not relational, i.e., we will never have to do a SELECT query for all player's games that have an Ace \(for all games\).

### `script.js`  `createGame`

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js\#L45](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js#L45)

When the page loads we display a "Create Game" button. When the user clicks this button we'll create a single game in the database.

### Create Controller

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs\#L115](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs#L115)

Specifically in the `create` controller we make a new game record using Sequelize.

This controller [has all the card and deck logic inside of it](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs#L7).

We create and shuffle a new deck, [then save it in the database.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs#L129)

### `script.js` `runGame`

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js\#L8](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js#L8)

When the browser receives the response to creating a game, it displays the hand the server dealt using the `runGame` function.

When a game is created in the database, a deal cards button is created.

### `script.js` `dealCards`

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js\#L28](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/public/script.js#L28)

When the user clicks the `Deal` button, a PUT request is made to the server. This request will alter the cards in the game and respond with two new cards dealt from the deck.

### Deal Controller

[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs\#L145](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-swe1/blob/main/controllers/games.mjs#L145)

The deal controller gets a game id in the request. It uses that to find the game, deal two new cards into the player hand object, update that in the database and send back the two new cards. Note that the player in the browser has never seen the order of the deck, so they cannot cheat.

## Exercise

Add functionality in the server that evaluates if the user has "won" by drawing any card \(of the two\) that was higher than the last pair. Send that information back in the response to the request.
