# 5.3: Webpack

![](../.gitbook/assets/webpac.jpg)



1. The webpack command is run. Webpack, based on the settings, takes the src/script.js file \(or whatever other files or groups of files are specified\) and transforms it, putting the resulting file in `./dist`.
2. The browser makes a request to the server for a page.
3. The browser reads a script tag in the HTML response. The script tag `src` source triggers a get request.
4. The Express.js server, based on the request path, looks in the hard drive for a file that matches the request. This script tag requests the transformed `script.js` file in `./dist`.
5. Because the request was kicked off from a script tag, the file contents response is digested by the JavaScript interpreter of the browser.

## Webpack Example

Create a directory and install webpack

```text
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Create some files to work with:

```text
mkdir src dist
touch src/script.js
touch dist/index.html
```

#### src/script.js

```text
console.log('hello');
```

#### dist/index.html

```text
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
     <title>Getting Started</title>
   </head>
   <body>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
   </body>
 </html>
```

### Webpack configurtation:

webpack.config.js

```text
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

```text

```

### Running Webpack

When we run webpack it will transform our script.js into main.js in the dist directory.
