# 5.1: DOM Manipulation

1. The browser makes a request to the server.
2. The Express.js server sends back HTML.
3. The browser reads a script tag in the HTML response. The script tag src source triggers a get request.
4. The Express.js server, based on the request path, looks in the hard drive for a file that matches the request and sends the file contents back in the response.
5. Because the request was kicked off from a script tag, the file contents response is digested by the JavaScript interpreter of the browser.
