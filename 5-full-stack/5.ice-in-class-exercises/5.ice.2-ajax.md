# 5.ICE.2: AJAX

## Introduction

Create an app that renders page elements with AJAX.

### Setup

1. Clone the [AJAX starter repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-swe1)
2. Install NPM packages with `npm i`
3. Initialise the DB with Sequelize migrate and seed commands
4. The starter code contains seed data for items, and a single route `/items`. Run the app and test the `/items` route in the browser: http://localhost:3004/items.

## Base

Create a route at the root \(`/`\) path that renders an HTML page with a button. When a user clicks the button, make an AJAX request to `/items` and use the response data to render a set of HTML elements for each item.

## Comfortable

1. Update our frontend code such that the AJAX request to `/items`, instead of displaying each item's description, displays a button for each item.
2. Create a new server route for individual items `/items/:id` that responds with the relevant item's description.
3. Update our frontend code such that when a user clicks an item's button, retrieve and render the item's description using an AJAX request.

## More Comfortable

Migrate the database so that items have categories. Change the seed data so that items have categories. Change the / page so that the button renders a list of category buttons instead.

When the user clicks on a category button, make a request to `/categories/:id/items` when the response it received, use the data to render a list of items.
