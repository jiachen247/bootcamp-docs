# 5.ICE.2: AJAX

You will be creating an app that renders information on the page with AJAX.

Begin by cloning the starter repo.

Set the app up by running `npm install` and setting up the database with the relevant Sequelize commands: migrate, seed, etc.

This app contains seed data for a number of items, and a single route `/items`. Test the items route out in the browser: http://localhjost:3004/items.

## Base

Make a page at root `/`. On this page place a button. When the user clicks the button, make an AJAX request to `/items` and use the data in the response to build a set of elements for each item.

## Comfortable

Refactor your code. Instead of the item description, display a button.

When the button gets clicked, send an AJAX request to the server to get the item: `/items/:id` . Add this new route to the server.

When the response to the request comes back, render the item description data onto the page.
