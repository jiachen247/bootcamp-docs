# 2.13.2: JSON File Storage Module - Passing Callbacks

## Introduction

Currently the logic that runs after a file is read into memory is hard-coded in `jsonFileStorage` \(e.g. in the `add` function. This is not ideal because we would need to create a new function that repeats file reading and writing code for each type of file edit operation, like we did in [2.ICE.5: Reading and Writing to JSON](../2.ice-in-class-exercises/2.ice.5-json-cards.md#limitations-with-current-jsonfilestorage-module). A more elegant solution would be to pass custom edit operation logic into `jsonFileStorage` so that `jsonFileStorage` can continue to be generic, and we can re-use it across apps without repeating code.

## Temperatures

Let's build an app that records a list of temperatures in a JSON file. The app will also average out the temperatures in the file.

We'll build more features in `jsonFileStorage` such that we will be able to use the exact same module code later for other apps.

### `data.json`

```javascript
{
  "temperatures": [23,32,43,12]
}
```

If we use the current functionality in jsonFileStorage it would look like this:

### index.js

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

read('data.json'); // this will print out all the temperatures
```

But, we want to be able to get the average of all the temperatures.

If our code _wasn't_ in a module, we could do this:

### index.js

```javascript
const handleFileRead = (error, jsonContent) => {
  // check for reading errors
  if (error) {
    console.log('reading error', error);
  }

  // start dealing with the JSON

  // parse the string into a *real* JavaScript object
  const content = JSON.parse(jsonContent);

  // access the key and make a new variable for readability
  const temperatures = content.temperatures;

  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i += 1) {
    total += temperatures[i];
  }

  const average = total / temperatures.length;

  console.log(average);
};

// read the file
readFile('data.json', 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
```

But, how do we keep our `jsonFileStorage` module relatively intact and usable for other apps, but be able to run our averaging code inside of `index.js`?

## Write Your Own Callback

We can move `handleFileRead` into `index.js` and pass it as a value to `jsonFileStorage`.

### index.js

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

const handleFileRead = (error, jsonContent) => {
  // check for reading errors
  if (error) {
    console.log('reading error', error);
  }

  // start dealing with the JSON

  // parse the string into a *real* JavaScript object
  const content = JSON.parse(jsonContent);

  // access the key and make a new variable for readability
  const temperatures = content.temperatures;

  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i += 1) {
    total += temperatures[i];
  }

  const average = total / temperatures.length;

  console.log(average);
};

read('data.json', handleFileRead);
```

### jsonFileStorage.js

```javascript
import { readFile } from 'fs';

export function read(filename, handleFileRead) {
  // read the file
  readFile(filename, 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
}
```

## Run Your Own Callback

This is ok, however, we know that if we want to reuse jsonFileStorage in other places, things like `JSON.parse` will need to be run every time. In the version above `JSON.parse` is written in `index.js`. We want a way to have that `JSON.parse` code inside the module.

In order to accomplish that, we can not only define our own callback, _**but run it too.**_

### index.js

We're creating a function `whenJsonIsRead` and it will receive the JavaScript object \(not a string\) as a parameter. Lines 6-16 are unaltered from the other versions. They simply average the numbers in the array.

```javascript
import { read } from 'jsonFileStorage.js';

// jsonContent is a JavaScript object. Not a string.
const whenJsonIsRead = (jsonContent) => {
  // access the key and make a new variable for readability
  const temperatures = jsonContent.temperatures;

  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i += 1) {
    total += temperatures[i];
  }

  const average = total / temperatures.length;

  console.log(average);
};

read('data.json', whenJsonIsRead);
```

### jsonFileStorage.js

This file deals with parsing the JSON string into a JavaScript object.

On line 1 we accept a function as an argument to the `read` function.

On line 14 **after the file is read, and the JSON is parsed**, we call the `whenJsonIsRead` function and pass in the JavaScript object we got from the file.

```javascript
import { readFile } from 'fs';

// read the file at `filename` and call the callback function `whenJsonIsRead`.
// callback `whenJsonIsRead` takes 1 parameter, the parsed JSON content.
export function read(filename, whenJsonIsRead) {
  const handleFileRead = (error, jsonContent) => {
    // check for reading errors
    if (error) {
      console.log('reading error', error);
    }

    // start dealing with the JSON

    // parse the string into a *real* JavaScript object
    const content = JSON.parse(jsonContent);

    // call the function that got passed in
    whenJsonIsRead(content);
  };

  // read the file
  readFile(filename, 'utf-8', handleFileRead);
}
```

### Line 14 allows us to pass data back into the function in the index.js file.

This allows us to keep generic actions like `JSON.parse` in the module file code.

To understand the flow of control make sure you are following both the code in `jsonFileStorage.js` and `index.js`.

## Exercise

Try out each version of the code.

Copy the final version of this code. Add `console.log` to the beginning of each block and before and after each function call in both files to see the control flow.
