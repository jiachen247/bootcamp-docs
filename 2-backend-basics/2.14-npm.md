# 2.14: npm

## Introduction

npm is a command line command that helps manage your Node.js project.

Create a folder with an npm project inside it.

```text
mkdir my-first-npm-project
cd my-first-npm-project
npm init -y
```

## package.json

Open the `package.json` file in VSCode.

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

`package.json` is the file that has all the configuration info about your project. Just like you have a single git repo for a project, you also have a single `package.json` file for a project.

## Downloading Library Code

NPM allows us to download code library modules from the internet.

```text
npm install cows
```

These are called packages. Every package can be accessed in several different forms.

Let's take the one in the example above:

* You can download it from the command line by mentioning it's official name. \(In this case `cows`\).
* You can visit the official [npm website page for that package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows)
* Almost every npm package has a [github.com repo.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows)

## Require

Before Node.js version 12 there was a different default syntax for getting a hold of code in different files. \(For our current purposes the two are exactly the same. There are a few differences when we get to React\).

Many packages still demonstrate this older way of requiring a package into a file:

```javascript
const cows = require('cows');
```

The equivalent statement in import syntax would be to assume an `export default`:

```javascript
import cows from 'cows';
```

For RA's default Node.js setup we will only use `import`. In order to use `import` with Node.js this key/value must be added to the `package.json`: `"type":"module"`.

## Dependency Graph

The developer ecosystem around npm \(and all package systems\) means that one package can depend on another package, and so on. Specifically the developers of a given package can, in the package they are writing, do `npm install` for package code they will use in their own package. In a modern node package this dependency graph grows quite large.

This is the dependency graph for react:

## Dependencies

After running the install command, 3 things will change.

#### package.json

A new key in package.json called "dependencies" will be added. When you run a command like `npm install cows`, npm knows which version to download \(you can also specify one\) and writes that into package.json. \(If the dependencies key already exists, the library will be added inside\).

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "cows": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

#### Install another package to see that line get added to the package.json file.

#### node\_modules

A folder called `node_modules` will be created with all the actual library code inside. This folder contains a folder each for every dependency of a dependency. \(That is to say, if a dependency had a dependency, it does not go _nested inside_ a folder\).

Look for the `index.js` file of a package inside `node_modules`. Is the code recognizable?

#### package-lock.json

`npm install cows` decides what version of cows package to install on your computer and which version to put in `package.json`. `package-lock.json` records the exact versions of all the dependencies of the `cows` library, so that if an install happens later on, the same exact dependency library versions are used.

### Development Dependencies

You may have noticed that the ESLint dependencies in the Coding Bootcamp repos are stored in a section called "devDependencies". dev or development dependencies are dependencies used purely for development purposes, which developers do not want to be included in the application package deployed to end users. The primary reason for this is to reduce the size of the application package for faster load times.

To install packages to dev dependencies, modify the install command slightly to include the `-D` flag.
