# 2.14: NPM

## Introduction

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) \(Node Package Manager\) is the most popular package manager for Node that allows us to incorporate 3rd-party software packages \(aka libraries\) in our apps. We will be using `npm` for the rest of Bootcamp to build more complex apps that rely on 3rd-party packages.

## Setup

Create a folder with an NPM project inside it. `npm init` initialises the NPM project, and the `-y` flag sets our answers to `yes` for all of the setup questions.

```text
mkdir my-first-npm-project
cd my-first-npm-project
npm init -y
```

## package.json

`package.json` specifies all configuration for our Node project managed by NPM. It operates similarly to the `.git` folder in our Git repos that configures everything Git-related for each repo.

We should see something like the following if we open the generated `package.json` file in VSCode.

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Installing NPM Packages

NPM allows us to download 3rd-party code packages from the Internet to add functionality to our apps without writing too much code ourselves. The following command downloads and installs a [package to create ASCII cow images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows).

```text
npm install cows
```

We can engage with NPM packages in several ways. Typically we discover packages through googling and references from google results like tutorials.

1. We can download packages from the command line with `npm install`.
2. We can visit the [NPM website for that package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows) to learn how to use it.
3. We can visit the [GitHub repo for that package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows) to see its source code.

## Require vs. Import Syntax

So far we've been using `import` syntax to import Node modules. Before Node version 12 the default syntax was `require`, and much documentation online still references the old `require` syntax. 

For RA's Bootcamp there is no practical difference between `import` and `require`, but we will use `import` where we can for consistency. To use `import` with Node.js we will need to add the `"type": "module"` key-value pair to `package.json`.

#### Require Syntax

```javascript
const cows = require('cows');
```

#### Import Syntax

The equivalent statement in import syntax assumes an `export default` from the imported module. There are no named exports with `require` syntax.

```javascript
import cows from 'cows';
```

## Dependency Graph

The developer ecosystem around npm \(and all package systems\) means that one package can depend on another package, and so on. Specifically the developers of a given package can, in the package they are writing, do `npm install` for package code they will use in their own package. In a modern node package this dependency graph grows quite large.

This is the dependency graph for react:

You can also check out the graph for[ ESLint here. ](http://npm.broofa.com/?q=eslint)

## Dependencies

After running the install command, 3 things will change.

#### package.json

A new key in package.json called "dependencies" will be added. When you run a command like `npm install cows`, npm knows which version to download \(you can also specify one\) and writes that into package.json. \(If the dependencies key already exists, the library will be added inside\).

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "cows": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```

#### Install another package to see that line get added to the package.json file.

#### node\_modules

A folder called `node_modules` will be created with all the actual library code inside. This folder contains a folder each for every dependency of a dependency. \(That is to say, if a dependency had a dependency, it does not go _nested inside_ a folder\).

Look for the `index.js` file of a package inside `node_modules`. Is the code recognizable?

#### package-lock.json

`npm install cows` decides what version of cows package to install on your computer and which version to put in `package.json`. `package-lock.json` records the exact versions of all the dependencies of the `cows` library, so that if an install happens later on, the same exact dependency library versions are used.

### Development Dependencies

You may have noticed that the ESLint dependencies in the Coding Bootcamp repos are stored in a section called "devDependencies". dev or development dependencies are dependencies used purely for development purposes, which developers do not want to be included in the application package deployed to end users. The primary reason for this is to reduce the size of the application package for faster load times.

To install packages to dev dependencies, modify the install command slightly to include the `-D` flag.
