# 2.10: HTTP File Server

## Introduction

Servers can respond to requests with arbitrary data, including files. Servers designed to return files to clients are known as "file servers". The request might specify a file path, and the server might respond with that file if it exists.

![The Node.js file server can serve local files to computers that request them from the Internet.](../.gitbook/assets/file-server-node.jpg)

## Example File Server

The following code illustrates how we might write a file server that returns a local file based on a file path specified in the URL.

#### index.js

```javascript
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { readFile } from 'fs';

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  // request.url contains the portion of the URL after the domain.
  // E.g. for https://ra.co/index.html, request.url would return "/index.html".
  console.log('request url', request.url);

  // "." refers to the Unix filesystem ".", which represents the current directory.
  const filePath = '.' + request.url;

  readFile(filePath, (err, content) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('error reading file', err);
      return;
    }
    // Set the response code to 200 (i.e. OK)
    response.writeHead(200);
    // Send the response with the file content in utf-8 format
    response.end(content, 'utf-8');
  });
};

// Initialise server with request listener function handleIncomingRequest
// https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener
// Use port 3004 by convention.
createServer(handleIncomingRequest).listen(3004);
```

## Create Text File to Serve

Create text file `hello.txt` with the following content. We will have our file server serve this file.

#### hello.txt

```javascript
Hello My Text File.
```

## Run Server

When we execute `index.js` above, the code runs indefinitely at the server's `.listen` method. It waits for incoming requests until we press `Ctrl+C` \(which sends an interrupt signal\) to exit. Look for the running server process in the Activity Monitor \(Mac\) or Task Manager \(Windows\).

```javascript
node index.js
```

## Make Request to Server from Browser

Visit [http://localhost:3004/hello.txt](http://localhost:3004/hello.txt) from our browser to retrieve our hello.txt file content. `localhost` is the default domain name of servers running on our local machine, and has a corresponding IP address of 127.0.0.1. We use the path component of the URL to tell the `readFile` function where to look on the computer. 

It's common practice to use URL paths to retrieve specific resources from servers. We can set up our servers to only expose certain files to clients, e.g. by setting up a `public` folder with only files that should be shared publicly, such as CSS files and other static resources like images. We will learn more about how to do this in later modules.

## Exercise

1. Clone [the base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Execute the above code.
3. Request for a file that does not exist.
4. Create an HTML file in the same directory and request for it from the browser.
5. Observe the request to the server in the Chrome DevTools Network tab.
6. Copy all files from the Video Poker project into the directory and request for the HTML file from the browser. Does the game work?
   1. You may notice that your CSS files don't load. This is because when servers respond with non-text files, they need to send back a "MIME type" header to let the client know what type of file it is. Past student Zaffere wrote an explanation of how this works [here](https://pastebin.com/vCRjijqf).
