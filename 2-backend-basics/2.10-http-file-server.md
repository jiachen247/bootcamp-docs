# 2.10: HTTP File Server

## Introduction

Servers can respond to requests with arbitrary data, including files. Servers designed to return files to clients are known as "file servers". The request might specify a file path, and the server might respond with that file if it exists.

![The Node.js file server can serve local files to computers that request them from the Internet.](../.gitbook/assets/file-server-node.jpg)

### Sample index.js for File Server

```javascript
// http is a built-in global Node.js module.
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { readFile } from 'fs';

// Use port 3004 by convention.
const PORT = 3004;

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  // request.url contains the portion of the URL after the domain.
  // E.g. for https://ra.co/index.html, request.url would return "/index.html".
  console.log('request url', request.url);

  // "." refers to the Unix filesystem ".", which represents the current directory.
  const filePath = '.' + request.url;

  readFile(filePath, (err, content) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('error reading file', err);
      return;
    }
    // Set the response code to 200 (i.e. OK)
    // https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers
    response.writeHead(200);
    // Sent the response with the file content in utf-8 format
    response.end(content, 'utf-8');
  });
};

// Initialise server with request listener function handleIncomingRequest
// https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener
createServer(handleIncomingRequest).listen(PORT);
```

## Create Text File

Create text file `hello.txt` with the following content. We will have our file server serve this file.

#### hello.txt

```javascript
Hello My Text File.
```

## Run Server

When we execute `index.js` above, the code runs indefinitely at the server's `.listen` method. It waits for incoming requests until we press `Ctrl+C` \(which sends an interrupt signal\) to exit. Look for the running server process in the Activity Monitor \(Mac\) or Task Manager \(Windows\).

```javascript
node index.js
```

## Make Request to Server from Browser

Visit [http://localhost:3004/hello.txt](http://localhost:3004/hello.txt) from our browser. `localhost` is the default domain name of servers running on our local machine, and has a corresponding IP address of 127.0.0.1. We use the path component of the URL to tell the `readFile` function where to look on the computer. We'll continue to use URL paths to reference certain local resources in our servers.

## Exercise

1. Clone [the base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Execute the above code.
3. Request for a file that does not exist.
4. Create an HTML file in the same directory and request for it from the browser.
5. Observe the request to the server in the Chrome DevTools Network tab.
6. Copy all files from the Video Poker project into the directory and request for the HTML file from the browser. Does the game work?
