# 2.ICE.2: Modules, Disk Reading

## Setup

Start with the [base node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## CSS Conversion Module

Extract CSS command line conversions from [2.POCE.1: CSS Command Line](../2.poce-post-class-exercises/2.poce.1-css-command-line.md) into a module file called `cssConvert.js`. The module should export all the conversion functions.

## JavaScript Comment Reader

Read in a JavaScript file as per examples in [Module 2.4](../2.4-disk-reading.md#basic-example). Output the line numbers that have comments in them, each on a new line with the relevant comment.

**myJsFile.js**

```javascript
// Add 2 numbers and return the result
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

Read in the JS file.

```text
node index.js myJsFile.js
```

Output:

```text
Line 1: "Add 2 numbers and return the result"
```

Move the comment-reading code into its own module, e.g. `showComments.js`, that exports a function `showComments` that takes a filename as input. 

#### index.js

```javascript
import showComments from 'showComments.js';

// ...

const output = showComments(filename);
console.log(output);
```

## Comfortable

List all the functions in the code and their parameters. This should work for functions in general and not just the specific function in the example below.

```javascript
// a function that adds two numbers together
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

```text
node index.js myJsFile.js
```

Outputs:

```text
add: parameters: a, b
```

Add the code to the above module.

Add an option to list the functions by line number or alphabetically by their name.

## More Comfortable

Allow your program to take an absolute path and find all files in that directory named `script.js` and do the analysis on those files.

```text
node index.js '/Users/kai/code' script.js
```
