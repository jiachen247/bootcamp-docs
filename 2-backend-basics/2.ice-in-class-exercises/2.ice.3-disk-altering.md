# 2.ICE.3: Disk Altering

## Setup

Start with the [base Node repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp).

## JavaScript Processor

Read in a JavaScript file. Change all the comments from `//` style to `/* */`. Keep them on the same line.

#### script.js

```javascript
// Add 2 numbers and return the result
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

#### Sample Command

```text
node index.js script.js
```

#### Subsequent script.js

```javascript
/* a function that adds two numbers together */
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

## Comfortable

### HTML Generator

```text
node html.js default.html
```

Create a command line program `html.js` that generates an HTML file based on the [Bootstrap getting started template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template). Have an `h1` inside the HTML body that says "hello". We will add onto this script in the following exercises.

### Variable Number of Images in HTML

[Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) allows us to insert placeholder images in our HTML. Update `html.js` to accept a number of `img` tags \(with placeholder images\) to render in the HTML body.

```text
node html.js images.html 4
```

### Columns in HTML

Update `html.js` to accept another parameter that specifies a number of Bootstrap columns on the page.

```text
node html.js columns.html 4 3
```

## More Comfortable

### Photo Gallery

```text
node html.js gallery.html /path/to/photos
```

1. Update `html.js` to accept a path argument to a folder that contains a set of photos.
2. Use `fs` to copy the files into the HTML file's folder and build an `img` tag for each image file with the correct relative path.
