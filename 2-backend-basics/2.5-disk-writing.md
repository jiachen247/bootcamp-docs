# 2.5: Disk Writing

## Introduction

Writing to disk allows us to save data from our JavaScript file to our hard drive, enabling that data to persist until it is explicitly deleted.

![We can make data flow from our JavaScript programs to disk and back.](../.gitbook/assets/disk-node.jpg)

## Sample Code

The following code uses the Node.js `fs` library to write data to disk.

```javascript
import { writeFile } from 'fs';

const content = 'Some content!';

const whenFileIsDoneWriting = (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log('success!');
    // file written successfully
  }
};

writeFile('test.txt', content, whenFileIsDoneWriting);
```

## Newlines

You can create a new line in a text file by appending the `\n` character. The following example changes the contents of the `content` variable by adding newline characters in a loop.

```javascript
let content = 'Printing 10 numbers:';
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
  content += `Random number: ${i}: ${Math.random()}\n`;
}
```

## Exercise

1. Clone [the base Node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-bootcamp)
2. Run the above code.
3. Open the file in VSCode to confirm it's contents are the ones you specified in the JavaScript file.
