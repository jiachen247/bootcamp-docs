## Module 2 Setup

## Install Packages

### Node.js

#### Mac

Install Node version 14 with the following command.

```text
brew install node@14
```

#### Windows

You should already have Node installed. Check by typing the following in the terminal, which will check the Node version.

```text
node -v
```

### Ngrok

Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) using the commands below. We will use `ngrok` for one of in-class exercises to expose our local servers to the Internet.

#### Mac

```

#### Ubuntu

```text
sudo npm install -g ngrok
```

## New Online Accounts

### AWS

Sign up for an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com) if you don't have one already. We will use this to set up servers in the cloud to which we will deploy our code.

### Namecheap

Sign up for a [Namecheap account](https://namecheap.com) to buy a domain name.

## WSL

For Windows, Module 2 marks a point that we will change the way files are stored and edited. From now on all files will be created and saved inside the Ubuntu / WSL part of the computer.

#### Working between WSL and Windows files

Get access to all the files in your WSL Ubuntu instance with this path:

```text
\\$wsl\Ubuntu
```

#### Opening a Windows file explorer from VSCode Terminal

Directly access files from a Windows file explorer window from the terminal by running explorer from within Ubuntu:

```text
/mnt/c/windows/explorer.exe <SOME_UNIX_PATH_TO_FILE>
```

Example: Open the current terminal directory:

```text
/mnt/c/windows/explorer.exe .
```

Open a new VSCode window for the current directory from the terminal:

```text
code .
```
