# 2.POCE.5: Noodle Website

## Introduction

We will upgrade the Noodle site we built in [1.POCE.1: Noodle Recipe Website](../../1-frontend-basics/1.poce-post-class-exercises/1.poce.1-noodles.md) with responsive layouts.

## Setup

1. Fork the [Noodle App CSS repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodle-app-css).

## Responsive Noodle Recipe Layouts

In [1.POCE.1: Noodle Recipe Website](../../1-frontend-basics/1.poce-post-class-exercises/1.poce.1-noodles.md) we created 3 types of pages.

1. Category page with list of all recipes in that category \(e.g. onion, chicken\)
2. Home page with list of all recipes and categories
3. Single recipe page with details about single recipe

### Instructions

1. Create responsive versions of the above pages according to the wireframes below.
2. Use Bootstrap for layout and choose a colour scheme of 2-3 colours.
3. Develop for mobile first because it is easier to add elements to a page to create desktop layouts than remove elements from a page to create mobile layouts. Starting with mobile will help our mobile views be simpler.

## Deploy to EC2

Use the [base file server repo application](https://github.com/rocketacademy/file-server-example-bootcamp) to serve files.

Inside this repo, clone your noodle app. \(This is an exception to the rule of not having repositories inside repositories\).

Your file server will then have access to the HTML and CSS noodle app files inside of the folder.

You should be able to access your noodle website at something like: [http://18.234.213.11/noode-app-css/index.html](http://18.234.213.11/noode-app-css/index.html)

Note that the way the file server app works, and the way this URL is formatted is that the URL path is the same as the noodle app directory name.

#### How do I update my repo after I've cloned it?

Read ahead to [2.17: git pull](../2.17-git-pull.md)

## Video Poker

Deploy the video poker game on the same AWS instance.

Follow the same instructions above as for the noodle app repo.
