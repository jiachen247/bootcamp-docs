# 2.POCE.1: CSS Command Line

## Introduction

Create a command-line app to convert hex-code colours to RGB-code colours and vice versa.

Begin with this starter code repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/css-conversions-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/css-conversions-bootcamp). Remember to work on a forked copy and submit a pull request once done.

## Base

Implement hex to RGB conversion. You can use the mathematical conversion in [this ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623838/rgb-to-hex-and-hex-to-rgb)Stack Overflow answer. The focus of this exercise is to learn to build command line apps and not the math for conversions.

Running the following command...

```text
node index.js '#ffffff'
```

... should result in the following output.

```text
rgb(255,255,255)
```

## Comfortable

Implement RGB to hex conversion.

The following command \(note the quotes around the RGB input to escape parentheses characters\)...

```text
node index.js rgbhex 'rgb(255,255,255)'
```

... should result in the following output.

```text
#ffffff
```

## More Comfortable

1. Convert input colours to HSL format.
2. Convert any input colour format to the other two colour formats. E.g. RGB input can convert to both hex and HSL.
3. Auto-detect the input colour format in the \#2 app.
