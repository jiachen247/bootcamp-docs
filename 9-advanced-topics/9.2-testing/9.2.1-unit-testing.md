# 9.2.1: Unit Testing

Unit testing is the ability to setup and test a portion of a project's code in isolation \(i.e., units\).

## AJAX Card Game Testing

Before we can begin writing tests for our code we must have an architecture to our code that enables the running of the pure logic of the app in isolation from the rest of the system.

This idea is a big shift in the way that we think about how to structure our applications. Before we begin any project it must be created with unit testing in mind. Also note that this idea of the separation of concerns, i.e., logic vs. data for example, is already a part of software engineering best practices, whether or not unit testing is implemented on the app.

In order to demonstrate implementation of unit testing in an app, we'll first refactor the AJAX card game so that we can isolate the game functionality into a module that can be tested in isolation.

This way we can build a testable game module that doesn't rely on user actions or the database, where we can verify the behavior of the game easily.

### AJAX Cards Refactor

Take a look at the branch here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/tree/game-module](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/tree/game-module)

The card related functionality was moved into it's own module file here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/blob/game-module/game/index.mjs](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cards-ajax-bootcamp/blob/game-module/game/index.mjs)

We call a module function when the user deals the cards.

### Unit Testing Setup

Now we can install the testing libraries into the project and create a first test for the functionality we currently have.

`package.json` was edited so that we can run the `test` command:

```text
npm run test
```

## High Card Unit Test

Now that we have our card game refactored into a module and the unit tests setup into the project we can add some functionality to test.
