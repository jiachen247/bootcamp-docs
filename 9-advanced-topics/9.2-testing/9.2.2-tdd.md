# 9.2.2: TDD

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. TDD is a process of writing code that begins by explicitly translating the behaviours and requirements of an application into running tests. Before a line of the application code is written, a test will be written that defines that behaviour. Then the code to pass that test is added into the application.

Dice Game

Directions for play:

Roll the dice and keep the highest.

Roll the remaining dice and again set aside the highest.

Roll the last die, and add up your total. Write down your score.

If a player roils the highest total for a round, they win the round.

Keep score and the player who wins the most turns wins the game.

```text
 it("Rolls for one player", function () {
    const game = createGame();
    const playerHand = game.playerHand;
    const firstCardValue = 'first';
    const updatedGame = setUpdatedGame(firstCardValue,game);
    expect(updatedGame.winner).to.equal(null);
    expect(updatedGame.score).to.equal(0);
  });
```

```text
const rollDice = () => {
  const randomDecimal = Math.random() * 6;

  return Math.floor(randomDecimal) + 1;
};
```
