# 4.PCE.3: Project 2 MVC Refactor

We will use MVC to work to refactor your project into MVC.

## Branch

Create a branch for this work called mvc.

Remember to change the syntax of the push command to git push origin mvc.

## Refactor

The MVC architecture described in 4.3 should allow you to transfer over your app functionality one controller method \(route\) at a time.

Remember to try to rename things according to the [table in 4.3.](../4.3-mvc.md#names)

The flow of work should be as follows:

1. Create the routes file.
2. If there is not an existing controller yet, create the controller file.
3. For a single route, create it in the routes file and create a method for it in the controller.
4. If the model doesn't exist yet, create it.
5. Use the model in the controller. Send back plain text.
6. Create the appropriate view folder if it doesn't exist.
7. Create the view file.

Complete everything one controller at a time. Don't worry about completing a refactor of the entire app.

Some of your routes will not fit into a given DB table -&gt; model -&gt; controller paradigm, e.g. the logged in homepage, or another page that uses several models equally. Don't worry about that. You can put that route in whichever controller you choose, or you can also choose to make a controller especially for that page or set of pages.
