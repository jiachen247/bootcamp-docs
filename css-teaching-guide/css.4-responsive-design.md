## Pre-Class Material

### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
		<title>Responsive Design</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>I am responsive design</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Demo how adding the `meta` tag helps with the mobile view

Demo the difference when changing the `width=device-width` to `width=500`

### Instagram

Ask everyone to visit [https://www.instagram.com/instagram/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/instagram/?hl=en) on a chrome browser

Open the dev tools and show that they also added the `meta` tag

Make a joke about how FB changed their name because of this tag (i'm kidding please don't)

Ask them if they are able to zoom in

Demo on your HTML above how to prevent a user from zooming in by adding `maximum-scale=1`
