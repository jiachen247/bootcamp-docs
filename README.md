# Overview

## Welcome to SWE1!

SWE1 is Rocket Academy's flagship career conversion course. It builds on material from [SWE101: Intro to Coding](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co). By the end of SWE1, students can expect to be [job-ready full-stack software engineers](https://inewsnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5051722203_890e2dab19_b-811x900.jpg).

SWE1 is in [beta](https://medium.com/swlh/what-does-beta-really-mean-a8accc5e2354#:~:text=Alpha%3A%20The%20software%20is%20ready,scoped%20bug%20fixes%20are%20allowed.): it is ready for use, but the curriculum is incomplete. We will remove beta status once SWE1 has been fully developed and taught. Thank you for understanding!

## Modules

SWE1 consists of modules, each of which covers a significant topic within full-stack software engineering. Course content and schedule are subject to minor changes depending on industry trends and student progress.

## Schedule

Students are expected to be working on SWE1 minimally from 10am-6pm M-F. Each batch will meet for live classes for 2 hours per day. Unless otherwise specified, Odd batch numbers \(e.g. Batch 1, 3\) meet in the morning from 10am-12pm, and even batch numbers \(e.g. Batch 2, 4\) meet in the afternoon from 1-3pm. All times are in Singapore Time \(GMT+8\).

The SWE1 schedule is organised by Course Days and Schedule Days. Course Days mark days of the course from 1 to 112. Schedule Days correspond to calendar days, e.g. Week 13 Day 4, where each Schedule Day has a designated Course Day except for public holidays during the course. Please see the Batch X Schedule page for your batch's schedule, where X is your batch number.

The [Course Days](course-schedule/course-days.md) page lists deliverables for each day of the course. Deliverables typically consist of videos, reading, and coding exercises. Each day's deliverables are due by the **start** of that day's class. We will complete exercises based on each day's deliverables in pairs during class.

## Daily Meeting Agenda

1. Review yesterday's post-class work
2. Review today's pre-class material
3. Complete today's in-class exercise
4. Introduce today's post-class work
