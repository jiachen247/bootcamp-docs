## Schedule

Students are expected to spend a minimum of 8 hours a day \(ideally from 10am - 6pm\), every weekday, on coursework. This includes the 2 hours set aside for live sessions. Time slots for these live sessions depend on the  your class's batch number. 

* Odd batch numbers \(e.g, 1, 3 , 5\): 10am -12pm
* Even batch numbers \(e.g, 2, 4, 6\): 1pm - 3pm

Our schedule is organised by Course Days and Schedule Days. Course Days mark days of the course from 1.1 to 23.5. Schedule Days correspond to calendar days, e.g. Week 13 Day 4, where each Schedule Day has a designated Course Day except for public holidays during the course. Please see the Batch X Schedule page for your batch's schedule, where X is your batch number.

The Course Weeks pages list deliverables for each day of the course. Deliverables typically consist of videos, reading, and coding exercises. Each day's deliverables are due by the **start** of the day's class. We work on exercises based on each day's deliverables in pairs during class.

## Class Agenda

1. Review of post-class exercise\(s\) from the day before
2. Review of the day's pre-class material
3. Completion of the day's in-class exercise\(s\)
4. Introduction of the day's post-class exercise\(s\)
