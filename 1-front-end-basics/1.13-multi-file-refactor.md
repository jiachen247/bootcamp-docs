# 1.13: Multi File Refactor

When writing JavaScript for the browser we have the option of dealing with multiple files.

This can help us build the application by splitting it up into different parts.

These parts will differ depending on the project. As we advance in the complexity of our applications we'll split our code into smaller and smaller chunks according to what they do. This is for organization of the code and also so many devs can work on a project at the same time.

Inside of `index.html`:

```markup
<script src="globals.js"></script>
<script src="gameInit.js"></script>
<script src="gamePlay.js"></script>
```

- The browser reads these files one at a time in the order the script tags appear in the HTML.
- Once they are all loaded these files act as if you combine them together and run them.
- All values available in one file are available in another.

**globals.js**

```javascript
const PI = 3.14;

const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(playerTurn); // this will error. the browser hasn't read gameInit.js yet.
```

#### gameInit.js

```javascript
// this works - the script file is after the globals file in the index.html
console.log(PI);

let playerTurn = 1;

const subtract = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
```

## Exercise

Split one of your programs into at least two files.
