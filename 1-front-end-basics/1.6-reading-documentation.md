# 1.6: Reading Documentation

Due to the very wide scope of the tasks in SWE 1, Google searching for information will become more and more important in order to solve a problem or bug.

As the course moves on the students are expected to become increasingly more independent in their execution of the programming projects.

Reading the documentation for a given language, framework or library is crucial to moving ahead with a given task. However, this is not a simple task. It takes practice and will feel awkward when starting out. As you gain more experience you will create your own strategies for how to find and absorb different types of documentation in order to solve a given problem.

## Exercise

Check out the article on documentation [here](http://cassandrawilcox.me/beginners-guide-developer-documentation/).

Look up the documentation for the JavaScript [Date object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) \(You can also google around for the answer\).

Create a new copy of the [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-starter-code) Create a button that, when clicked, displays today's date.
