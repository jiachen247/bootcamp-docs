# 1.PCE.1: Noodle Recipe Website

Begin by forking this empty [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/html-noodles-swe1)

Create a set of seven HTML pages for noodle recipes.

Google four noodle recipes. Two recipes that have onions, two recipes that have chicken.

Create HTML pages for each recipe.

Each page has a standard amount of information:

- Recipe title
- Recipe ingredients
- Preparation time
- Instructions
- Food image

When searching for the four recipes save a copy of each of the images into your repo, and create a corresponding `img` tag in your HTML.

Create a main page that links to each noodle recipe page. \(Use an `a` tag\). Create a link on each other HTML page with a link back to the main page.

Create pages for the onion and chicken ingredients respectively. On each page, create lists of links to the recipes containing that ingredient, and a back link to the main page. Create links to the ingredient pages from the main page.

When you're done with the exercise create a pull request for your work.
