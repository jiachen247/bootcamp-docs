# 1.ICE.4: Straights Times CSS

![](../../.gitbook/assets/straights-times.jpg)

Recreate the website screenshot above. Note that this is not the real version of this page.

Refer to the [cheatsheet](../1.1-html-and-css/1.1.2-basic-css.md#exercise-tips-cheatsheet) to make the page easier to code.

This exercise is only for the mobile view of this page. To make this page look good on a laptop/desktop, put the contents of the site inside a container element. Set the `max-width` CSS style on this element and center the element using `margin: 0 auto;`.
