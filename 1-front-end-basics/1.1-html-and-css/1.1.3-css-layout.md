All webpages comprise a series of nested boxes that have CSS styles applied to each of them. The Learn Layout page in the Exercises section below cover all CSS basics to compose these boxes. 

## Exercises

The follow exercises are from [Learn Layout](https://learnlayout.com/). We will complete the first 16 pages and ignore pages 17-19. **After reading each page, implement the code to see how it works.**

### Part 1: Pages 1 to 8

Complete pages 1 to 8 at [https://learnlayout.com/](https://learnlayout.com/).

### Part 2: Pages 9 to 16

Complete pages 9 to 16 at [https://learnlayout.com/](https://learnlayout.com/).

## Meta Viewport

Exercise 14 mentions adding the viewport tag. If we want our mobile-first layouts to look good we need to add this tag so that the device knows how to properly scale the layout of the page.

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
