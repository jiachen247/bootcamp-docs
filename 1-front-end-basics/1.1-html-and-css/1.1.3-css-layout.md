To create the layout of any website page requires decomposing the design into a series of nested boxes that have CSS styles applied to them.

This site covers the basics of CSS you would need in order to compose these series of boxes.

**After reading each page, implement the code so you can see how it works.** \(This site doesn't have any explicit exercise sets\).
