# 1.POCE.6: Technical Documentation Page - Flexbox / Responsive

Begin with the starter code repo here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-swe1)

The page you are creating is the same technical documentation page: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)  
  
This version is different in two ways, it should be:

* mobile-first and responsive
* use flexbox for layout in the desktop

Use the advanced properties of flexbox, including `flex-wrap`, `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`. 

Take a look at the example here: [https://codepen.io/awongh-sandwich/pen/XWjvrQJ](https://codepen.io/awongh-sandwich/pen/XWjvrQJ)

Copy the example into the starter code. Play with the example above to understand how it works. What happens when you take off the `flex-wrap` in different screen widths? What about `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`?
