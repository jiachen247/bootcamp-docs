# 1.POCE.8: Personal Page - Flexbox

## Instructions

Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-swe1).

We will create the same personal page as in [Module 1.1: HTML & CSS.](../1.1-html-and-css/#html-css-exercise-personal-page)

Use flexbox and media queries to achieve the responsive behaviour in the [sample page.](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG)

Begin with the mobile layout first and use media queries to apply layout styles needed for the larger layout sizes.
