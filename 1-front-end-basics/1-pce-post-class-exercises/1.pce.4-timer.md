# 1.PCE.4 Timer

## setInterval Timer Patterns

### Match Game Timer

Add a countdown timer to the Match game. End the game if the time runs out.

###  Match Game Timer Reset

When the timer runs out, turn all the cards back over and reset the game. Message the user they've lost.

Work on this timer in stages:

1. A timer that counts up seconds, minutes and hours.
2. A timer that can be stopped and reset.
3. A timer that records lap times. \(Hint: what sort of way would you be able to record this data?\)
4. A timer that shows splits at each lap
