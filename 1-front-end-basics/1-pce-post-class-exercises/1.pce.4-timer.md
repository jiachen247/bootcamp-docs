## setInterval Timer Patterns

### Match Game Timer

Add a countdown timer to the Match game. End the game if the time runs out.

### Match Game Timer Reset

When the timer runs out, turn all the cards back over and reset the game. Message the user they've lost.

#### Work on this timer in stages:

**1\)** A timer that counts up seconds, minutes and hours.

**2\)** A timer that can be stopped and reset.

## More Comfortable

**3\)** A timer that records lap times.

\(Hint: what sort of data structure would you be able to use to record this lap data?\)

**4\)** A timer that shows splits at each lap
