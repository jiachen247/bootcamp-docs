# 1.PCE.3 Match Game

Build on your Match Game from [Module 1.9](../1-9-match-game.md). Remember to work on a forked copy of the [SWE1 Match Game repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/match-game-swe1), and submit a Pull Request when finished.

Complete the match game by building more complete DOM elements for the cards. \(show the card suit and name when it gets turned over\).

Display on the screen somewhere the state of the game, i.e., the user needs to click another card, or the user didn't find a match, etc.

## Match Game `setTimeout`

Optimize the Match Game to use `setTimeout`. When the user clicks a square for a second time, turn the card over _and if it doesn't match the first card_, show it to the user for 3 seconds then turn it back over.

## Match Game Match

When the user matches a card, show a match message for 3 seconds, then make it disappear.

## Match Game Timer

Give the user 3 minutes to complete the game. \(You can't display a countdown timer until setInterval, so the user won't be able to see the time left\).

## Full Match Game

Implement a full match game:

* The player can enter their name
* The game has a reset button
* The game keeps score of wins

## Match Game Wins

When the user matches all the cards, show a special message on screen for 5 seconds.
