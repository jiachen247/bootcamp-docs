# 1.ICE.1: Drawing Dom

Begin with the [DOM starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/swe101-next-steps-dom)

When the page loads use JavaScript to create 3 buttons on the screen. The HTML would look something like this:

```text
<div>
  <button>ðŸ˜„</button>
  <button>ðŸ˜Ž</button>
  <button>ðŸ˜¦</button>
</div>
```

When the user clicks on a button use a loop within a loop to create a square emoji figure.

Just like in the original drawing exercise you can use &lt;br/&gt; to create the new lines of the figure.

```text
<p>
  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„<br/>
  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„<br/>
  ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„<br/>
</p>
```

When the user clicks another button the current figure is erased and the new one put in it's place.

### Any Emoji

[Create an array of every emoji.](https://gist.github.com/anthonydelgado/528d1fab9242067348c0ac25f873d7f0) Use this array to create a button for each emoji.

### Any Key

Create a keydown event listener. For each key set a number of emojis that will appear on the screen. \(e.g., "a" makes 12 emojis appear\). When the user clicks the button, set the current emoji that will get displayed. When the user presses the key, display the emoji.

### Randomize

Create a randomize button that randomizes the number and emoji.

### Up Down Arrows

Set the keydown to the up and down arrows. When the user presses these keys the figure on screen gets one larger or smaller. 

### More Comfortable

### Top

When the user clicks to draw a figure, display it as over / under the current one- if the new emoji figure is bigger than the old one, it appears underneath. If the new emoji figure is smaller than the older one it appears on top. Figures are top left aligned.

### Up Down Arrows

Set the keydown to the up and down arrows. When the user presses these keys the figures on screen gets one closest ratio larger or smaller.
