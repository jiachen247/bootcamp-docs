# UX.3: How to Design Your App

### User Flows

User flows describes the series of high-level steps the user has to take to accomplish an action.

#### Steps:

1. Define who the user is
2. Define the user's goal. Goals are also called user stories.
3. Define the steps the user needs to take to accomplish that goal

#### User flow types:

1. Task flows
   1. Written list of things the user needs to do.
   2. Competitive Analysis. What do other apps do?
2. Wireflows
   1. Sketch the screens that represent the tasks. Include all  UI elements like inputs or buttons the user needs to accomplish the goal.
3. Screen Flows
   1. Fill in more details in the wireframe. Think about the information hierarchy / information architecture of the elements on the screen.

User stories define the intended user and business goals when interacting with a page. Wireframes should organize the content to support these goals.

#### Steps:

1. Define the intended user and business goals when interacting with a page.
2. Define specific calls to action, images and or content for this page
3. Include the specific buttons or UI elements or touch points does the user needs in order to accomplish the action.
4. Use information hierarchy / information architecture to dictate the design of information that is most or least important. Resize or rearrange elements according to these principles.

#### Things to keep in mind:

Don't surprise the user. Ask what the user expects to see in a certain areas of the page.

Define areas of the page using usability conventions: spacing, layout, information hierarchy. 

## UI Design / Information Architecture / Information Hierarchy

Information architecture is the process of designing a page or screen that gives the user information about what actions they should take and how they should look at that screen.
