# D.5: Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is one of the most powerful techniques in programming, albeit rarely used in business applications because business applications typically do not require it. Recursion is the concept of a function calling itself to achieve its result. A classic example is the Fibonacci sequence, where `Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)`. The `Fib` function would repeatedly call itself until it reaches a so-called **"base case"**, after which the latest function calls would then `return` to the previous function calls.

Recursion is an alternative to iteration \(i.e. loops\), and every problem that can be solved recursively should also be solvable iteratively. However, some problems are far easier to solve recursively or iteratively than vice versa, so recursion is an indispensable tool in the DS&A tool kit. 

There are 2 concepts to remember with recursion.

1. Recurrence relation
   1. When our function calls itself, what do we expect to be returned by that function?
2. Base case
   1. When does our function stop calling itself and return a value that does not depend on the function calling itself again?
   2. In our Fibonacci example, our base cases would be that `Fib(0) == 1` and `Fib(1) == 1`.
   3. Without base cases, our recursive function would recurse infinitely and result in an infinite loop.

## Optional Reading

1. Fast Exponentiation. What would be the time complexity of an algorithm to calculate the value of `2^n`, where `n` is an input value? A na√Øve solution would be to write a for loop to multiply 2 by itself `n` times, which would run in `O(n)` time complexity. However, if we take the notion that `2^2^2 == 2^4` , and `2^4^2 == 2^8`, we can see that we can calculate `2^n` in many fewer operations than `n`, on the order of `log(n)`, with time complexity of `O(logn)`. Fast exponentiation can be implemented relatively easily with recursion. Programming languages typically implement exponent operators using fast exponentiation.
