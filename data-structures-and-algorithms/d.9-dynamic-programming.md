# D.9: Dynamic Programming

## Introduction

Dynamic programming allows us to optimise recursive solutions by "caching" intermediate calculation results to reduce repeated and redundant calculations.

## Helpful Resources

1. Read pages 143-148 in [CTCI](d.0-module-d-overview.md#resources) on DP
2. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYquumk4nWw) video illustrates 2 fundamental examples of dynamic programming with the Fibonacci sequence.
3. [This](https://awjin.me/algos-js/dp/tab-memo.html) article describes the differences between memoisation and tabulation methods of DP
