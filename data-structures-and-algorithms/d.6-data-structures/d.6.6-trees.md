# D.6.6: Trees

## Introduction

Trees are a common data structure used to represent hierarchical data, often seen in DS&A problems. Trees are essentially linked lists where nodes are ordered from top to bottom instead of left to right, and each node can have more than 1 subsequent node, called "child nodes" in trees. Each child node can only have 1 parent node, and nodes with no child nodes are called "leaf nodes". Nodes in trees generally contain a data payload \(e.g. a number\), and pointers to each respective child node.
