# D.6.2: Hash Tables

## Introduction

Hash tables are the generalised computer-science concept behind JavaScript Objects. Most programming languages have their own implementation of hash tables, e.g. Dictionaries in Python, HashMaps in Java.

## Hash Table Theory

See [this article](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/) for a brief explanation of hash table theory.

## Hash Table Usage Examples

In DSA problems, hash tables are typically used for 1 of 2 purposes.

1. Tally frequencies of elements in a collection
2. Creating mappings between values and relevant metadata, for example between values in an array and their corresponding indices.

See [this Repl](https://repl.it/@kaiyuanneo/hashmapapplications#main.py) for examples of the above usage patterns compiled by one of RA's former instructors Jon.
