# D.10: Common Patterns

## Introduction

This module reviews common algorithmic patterns in DS&A interview problems.

### Sliding Window

Sliding window algorithms generally store a start and end index of a "window" in an array, and update that start and end index as we iterate through the array. See [this](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/an-introduction-to-sliding-window-algorithms-5533c4fe1cc7) explanation for an intro to sliding window algorithms.

### Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is commonly taught in core computer science courses to help students understand how numbers are represented and manipulated by computers. Some companies use bit manipulation in their interview processes.

1. Please read about the 6 main bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>` [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-bitwise-operators--active-11301). These operators can be used in Python to perform bitwise operations.
2. Please read pages 124-128 on Bit Manipulation in [CTCI](../d.0-module-d-overview.md#resources).
