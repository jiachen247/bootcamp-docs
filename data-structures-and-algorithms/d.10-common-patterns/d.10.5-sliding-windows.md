# D.10.5: Sliding Windows

### Introduction

Sliding window algorithms generally store a start and end index of a "window" in an array, and update that start and end index as we iterate through the array. See [this](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/an-introduction-to-sliding-window-algorithms-5533c4fe1cc7) explanation for an intro to sliding window algorithms.
