# D.10.2: Breadth-First Search

## Exercises

For each exercise, please answer why this is more efficiently solved with BFS than DFS. Consider using Python's built-in `deque` data structure [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) for a more efficient queue implementation than `list`. `deque` is implemented with a doubly-linked list, thus dequeue is a O\(1\) operation. Specifically, see the [`popleft` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque.popleft).
