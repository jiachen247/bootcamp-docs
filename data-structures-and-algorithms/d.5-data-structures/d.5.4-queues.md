# D.5.4: Queues

## Introduction

Queues are similar to stacks except instead of removing elements from the end of a list, we can only remove elements from the front of a list. Instead of push and pop operations, queues have "enqueue" and "dequeue" operations respectively. Enqueue adds an element to the back of a queue, and dequeue removes an element from the front of a queue.
