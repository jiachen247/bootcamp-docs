# D.10: Common Patterns

## Introduction

This module reviews common algorithmic patterns in DS&A interview problems.

## Trees

### Depth-First Search

Most vanilla recursion applies DFS. For example, the naive Fibonacci implementation of Fib\(n\) might solve the entire Fib\(n-1\) subtree before recursing on Fib\(n-2\).
