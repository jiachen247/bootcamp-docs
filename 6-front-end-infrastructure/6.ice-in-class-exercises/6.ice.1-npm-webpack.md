2. Add the appropriate folders and files described in [Module 6.1.2: Webpack NPM](../6.1-webpack/6.1.2-webpack-with-npm.md).
3. Install [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) as a dependency of the project.
4. When the page loads, create a date input.
5. When the user enters a date into the date input, show a Moment formatted date in an `h2` element. The date should have the format: **January 12th, 1998**.
