# 6.ICE.1: NPM Webpack

Create a browser app that works with dates.

Begin by cloning the [base starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Add the appropriate folders and files described in the [webpack npm section.](../6.1-webpack/6.1.2-npm.md)

Install [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) as a dependency of the project.

## Base

When the page loads, create a date input. When the user enters a date into the date input, show a Moment formatted date in an `h2` element. The date should have the format: **January 12th, 1998**.

## Comfortable

Add the [copy to clipboard library.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard) When the user clicks a button, copy a moment formatted short date to the clipboard. The date should have the format: **1/12/98**.

## More Comfortable

Use the [browser's geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) and the [moment timezone library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-timezone) to show the names and times at all the other timezones in the world, in ascending order of difference from the user's current zone.
