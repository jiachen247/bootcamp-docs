# 6.1.3: Webpack with Babel

## Introduction

Another powerful feature of Webpack is to transform JS code according to a set of rules. In this module we will be using Babel to transform JS from ES6 to ES5 syntax. This enables us to write JS using the latest ES6 syntax, but deploy our code in the more widely-compatible ES5 syntax.

## Webpack Babel Example

### Initialise Project Folder

Create new folder and install Webpack.

```text
mkdir webpack-babel-demo
cd webpack-babel-demo
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

Install the Babel library to transform our JS code from ES6 to ES5.

```text
npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

Create folders and files that Webpack will use for compilation.

```text
mkdir src dist
touch src/script.js
touch dist/index.html
```

#### src/script.js

Populate `script.js` with the below code.

```javascript
const component = () => {
  // create an element
  const element = document.createElement('h1');

  // set the contents
  element.innerHTML = 'Hello!';

  // return the element
  return element;
};

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

#### dist/index.html

Populate an `index.html` file that will load Webpack's transformed `script.js`.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Configure Webpack

#### webpack.config.js

Create a file that tells Webpack what to transform and how. Notice this version of the Webpack config invokes Babel.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/script.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'script.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/, // regex to see which files to run babel on
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Run Webpack

Transform `src/script.js` into `dist/script.js`.

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

### Compare Webpack Compilation With and Without Babel

Observe the generated `dist/script.js` file. Let's generate this file without Babel and compare the results.

1. Copy the contents of `dist/script.js` to a new file `dist/script-with-babel.js`.
2. Update our Webpack config to remove Babel. 

#### webpack.config.js

Webpack config without Babel.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/script.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'script.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

Run Webpack again to generate a `dist/script.js` without Babel.

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

You may notice that in the Babel version of `script.js`, `const` has changed to `var`. What are other differences between the Babel and non-Babel versions of `script.js`?

## Presets

How does Babel know what to change? We installed some libraries that are telling it what to do.

**@babel/preset-env**

The settings that determine the behaviour of the transformations that Babel runs is set by the `presets` key in the Webpack config. The presets we have were installed as a package when we installed Babel.

See more about [preset-env here.](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)

### Browserlist

Part of the system of specifying what kind of code we want to run is a list of all browsers and what syntax they all support. This list is compiled and maintained by a library called Browserlist.

#### Targets

Browserlist defines what are called _**targets**_. These can be individual browser's versions, or a generalized range. If no setting are set, `@babel/preset-env` defaults to Browserlist's [defaults](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#queries): a set of wide-usage browsers defined by this setting:

```text
> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead
```

These specifications refer to: 99.5% of all browsers according to their statistics, the last two versions of all browsers, Firefox, and any browser that is "not dead". The code that Babel produces will run on this set of browsers.

Note that this setting is not in our code anywhere, it's just what you get if nothing else is set.

See more about [Browserlist's specifications here.](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)

## Polyfill

If your set of JavaScript needs more transformation than simply changing `const` to `var`, then it may need polyfills to support other types of code.

For example, if your code uses promises and you want that code to run on browsers that don't support promise syntax, you can tell Babel to transform that code into ES5 compatible JavaScript.

First we need to install a polyfill library.

`core-js` covers all the syntax in ES6 \(and later versions\) that are not in ES5.

```text
npm install -D core-js
```

Import `core-js` at the top of the file. Babel will know how to take the library and transform your code.

In order for Babel to know that it has to transform your code, add an `import` to the file mentioned as the Webpack config entry file \(`src/script.js`\). You can specify core-js code for the arrow function we defined. Babel will turn our arrow function into an ES5 function with all the features of an arrow function - arrow function scope, etc. Take a look at the differences [here](https://dmitripavlutin.com/differences-between-arrow-and-regular-functions/). `core-js` includes all the code to make our output function behave like an arrow function.

#### src/script.js

```javascript
import 'core-js/es/function';
```

Before you run webpack, save the last version of the output `dist/script.js` file for comparison.

```text
cp dist/script.js dist/script.2.js
```

Run Webpack:

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

### `dist/script.js`

Look in the generated script file. Babel has made some changes to this file so that it is more browser compatible. The added arrow function code is around 700 lines.

### Beautify

Install the [Beautify plugin for VSCode.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) This will allow you to read the file.

What else did Babel change in the file compared to `dist/script.2.js`? Can you recognize the code from the original `script.js`? \(It is at the bottom of the file\).

### `core-js` with promises

Let's take this simple example of using a promise with setTimeout:

```javascript
// import the entire core-js library
import 'core-js';

const setDelay = (delay) => {
  console.log(`delaying: ${delay}`);

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(delay), delay);
  });
};

const result = setDelay(randomNumber());

result.then((number) => {
  console.log('all done');
  console.log(number);
});
```

Run Webpack:

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

### `dist/script.js`

Look in the generated script file. `core-js` added all of the necessary libraries that fake having promises as part of the JavaScript language.
