# 6.1.5: Webpack + Express.js

The final version of our setup needs to be put into Express.js.

We'll describe all of the settings needed for that, and also the few things we need to make sure that everything still works when we deploy to Heroku.

We'll be working from this example repo here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/tree/full-example](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/tree/full-example)

There are two branches to this repo- `main` contains the base starter code, and `full-example` contains a full app with migrations and seed. We'll be going through the complete example branch.

## Webpack Config

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that it's not really important to understand the full Webpack config- in real life these configs are set very seldom.
{% endhint %}

We have split the webpack config into three files:

- config/webpack.common.js
- config/webpack.dev.js
- config/webpack.prod.js

The dev and prod files include the common files.

#### package.json

We are explicitly setting the command to create the final production build in package.json. Heroku will use this command to know that our files need to be transformed.

We added a watch command so that Webpack automatically rebuilds our code when it detects changes.

Note that each command uses the different config files.

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.mjs",
  "watch": "webpack --watch --config webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js",
  "build": "webpack --config webpack_conf/webpack.prod.js"
},
```

### File Structure

We added specific folders for js - `src` and `dist`. Express is configured to serve files from `dist`.

### File Names

We added a hash to the name of file. [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.common.js\#L13](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.common.js#L13) Now, for each change to the file, we are changing the file name. This will "break the cache" of the browser, which is to say, the browser will always be sure to get the new contents of the file on page load.

See more about browser file caching and caching headers here: [https://medium.com/@codebyamir/a-web-developers-guide-to-browser-caching-cc41f3b73e7c](https://medium.com/@codebyamir/a-web-developers-guide-to-browser-caching-cc41f3b73e7c)

### Base HTML File

We set a base HTML file "template" from which to create our final page: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/js/src/index.html](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/js/src/index.html)

We set the config for this file here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js\#L30](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js#L30)

We instruct Express.js to server this file in the routes file here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/routes.mjs\#L13](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/routes.mjs#L13)

## Starting Express

In order to begin using the app you must use two terminals. One is to run `nodemon`, the other is to run Webpack with `npm run watch`.

## Heroku

This app is setup for using Sequelize with Heroku.

We added a second part to the databse config file here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/config/config.js](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/config/config.js)

When we get the database configs from the Heroku environment variable we set them into Sequelize in the model index: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/models/index.mjs](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/models/index.mjs)

### Build

When pushing to Heroku it will automatically run the `npm run build` step. Run this on the command line to see what will happen- Webpack creates a set of files in the `dist` folder.

We have also added the `dist` folder to the .gitignore file: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/.gitignore\#L7](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1/blob/full-example/.gitignore#L7)

## Exercise

Clone the repo and create a demo Heroku app based on the example.

### Local

```text
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1.git
```

```text
cd webpack-mvc-base-swe1
```

```text
git checkout full-example
```

```text
npm install
```

Change the `config/config.js` database config file. Add your username.

```text
npx sequelize db:create
```

```text
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

```text
npx sequelize db:seed:all
```

```text
nodemon index.mjs
```

Open a new terminal window:

```text
npm run watch
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3004/home](http://localhost:3004/home)

### Heroku

Create a Heroku app

```text
heroku create
```

Provision a Postgres database from the command line:

```text
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Push the code to Heroku. We need to specify a non-main branch.

```text
git push heroku full-example:main
```

Run the migrations on Heroku:

```text
heroku run npx sequelize db:migrate
```

```text
heroku run npx sequelize db:seed:all
```

You should be able to visit your app on Heroku now:

```text
heroku open /home
```
