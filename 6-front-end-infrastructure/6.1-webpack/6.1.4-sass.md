# 6.1.4: SASS

Webpack is not limited to controlling JavaScript files. It can transform any set of files that the browser loads and uses.

Sass is what's called a CSS pre-compiler. The Sass language is a variant of CSS that aims to limit the repetitiveness of some CSS syntax. We can use it by writing Sass and letting Webpack turn it into regular CSS.

Another advantage of Sass is that when we make a CSS syntax error, Sass will tell us before we even open the browser.

## Example

Create a directory and install Webpack

```text
mkdir sass-webpack-demo
cd sass-webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Create some files to work with:

```text
mkdir src dist
touch src/style.scss
touch src/script.js
touch src/dummy-css.js
touch dist/index.html
```

#### src/style.scss

```text
#loud{
    background-color:red;
}
```

#### src/script.js

```text
// all normal js stuff goes here
// ...
console.log('hi');
```

#### src/dummy-css.js

Webpack only transforms a file if it's mentioned in a javascript file. When we get to React we'll see a tighter integration between our CSS and JavaScript.

```text
// the css import statement in the js file tells
// Webpack to compile the sass files

import "./style.scss";
```

#### dist/index.html

```text
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
     <title>Getting Started</title>
     <!-- this path already refers to dist -->
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
   </head>
   <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
   </body>
 </html>
```

### Webpack configuration:

Install the Webpack packages:

```text
npm install --save-dev sass css-loader sass-loader mini-css-extract-plugin
```

#### webpack.config.js

```text
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: ['./src/script.js', './src/dummy-css.js'],
  output: {
    filename: 'script.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [new MiniCssExtractPlugin()],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: "css-loader",
          },
          "sass-loader"
      ]}
    ],
  },
};
```

## Run Webpack

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

### `dist/main.css`

This file contains the transformed scss file.

## SASS Syntax

Sass has many features, but we'll go over two main ones:

### Nesting

Instead of having to write a set of selectors for your css, you can write nested statements:

```text
<div class="card">
    <img class="profile-img">
</div>
```

#### CSS

```text
.card{
    height:100px;
    width:100px;
}

.card .profile-img{
    width:100%;
}
```

#### Sass

```text
.card{
    height:100px;
    width:100px;
    
    .profile-img{
        width:100%;
    }
}
```

### Variables

With variables we can do things like set a site-wide color scheme and use it with named colors in all CSS files.

```text
$base-color: #c6538c;
$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);

.card{
    height:100px;
    width:100px;
    border: 1px solid $border-dark;

    
    .profile-img{
        width:100%;
    }
}
```

Paste the examples into your file and look at the output file to see the Sass compiler work.
