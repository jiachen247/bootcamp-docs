# 6.1.4: Webpack with SASS

## Introduction

In addition to JS, Webpack is also able to transform CSS variants into CSS. SASS \(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets\) is a CSS pre-compiler and variant that reduces repetitiveness in CSS. With Webpack we can write SASS and have Webpack compile it into regular CSS that browsers support.

## Webpack SASS Example

### Initialise Project Folder

Create new folder and install Webpack.

```text
mkdir sass-webpack-demo
cd sass-webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

Create folders and files that Webpack will use for compilation.

```text
mkdir src dist
touch src/styles.scss
touch src/script.js
touch src/dummy-css.js
touch dist/index.html
```

#### src/styles.scss

Populate `styles.scss` with CSS. SCSS is a variant of SASS with syntax that is more similar to CSS. More on differences between SASS and SCSS [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-scss-and-sass/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20SCSS%20and%20SASS%20%3F,-Last%20Updated%20%3A%2016&text=SASS%20%28Syntactically%20Awesome%20Style%20Sheets,of%20the%20existing%20CSS%20syntax.).

```css
#loud {
  background-color: red;
}
```

#### src/script.js

Populate `script.js` with the below code.

```javascript
console.log('hi');
```

#### src/dummy-css.js

Webpack only transforms a file if that file is referenced in a JS file. When we learn React we will observe a tighter integration between JS and CSS.

```javascript
// This CSS import statement tells
// Webpack to compile the SCSS file
import './styles.scss';
```

#### dist/index.html

Populate an `index.html` file that will load Webpack's transformed `script.js` and `main.css`.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started</title>
    <!-- Webpack compiles CSS into main.css -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Configure Webpack

Install the following packages that Webpack needs to transform SASS to CSS.

```text
npm install --save-dev sass css-loader sass-loader mini-css-extract-plugin
```

#### webpack.config.js

Create a file that tells Webpack what to transform and how. Notice the CSS transformation configuration.

```javascript
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: ['./src/script.js', './src/dummy-css.js'],
  output: {
    filename: 'script.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  plugins: [new MiniCssExtractPlugin()],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
          },
          'sass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Run Webpack

Transform JS and CSS files in `src` to relevant files in `dist`. 

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

Observe the transformed CSS file in `dist`.

## SASS Syntax

SASS has many features, but we'll go over two main ones: nesting and variables.

### Nesting

SASS supports nested CSS selectors that closer mimic the nesting in HTML.

#### HTML

We may wish to apply styles only on `.profile-img` classes within a `.card` class.

```markup
<div class="card">
  <img class="profile-img" />
</div>
```

#### CSS

In regular CSS syntax, we would create a new CSS rule set with both `.card` and `.profile-img` selectors.

```css
.card {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}

.card .profile-img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

#### SASS

In SASS, we can nest the `.profile-img` rule set in the `.card` rule set for styles we only want to apply to `.profile-img` classes within `.card` classes.

```css
.card {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;

  .profile-img {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

### Variables

Variables in SASS make it easier to implement features such as site-wide colour schemes and use those colour schemes with named colours in all style sheets.

```css
$base-color: #c6538c;
$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);

.card {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  border: 1px solid $border-dark;

  .profile-img {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

### Exercises

Paste the above examples into your SASS file and observe the Webpack-compiled output file. What are the differences?
