# 6.1.1: NPM

With Webpack the ability to pre-compile our front-end code allows us to have many secondary benefits.

One is the ability to use the NPM library system to specify other sets of code we want into our JavaScript files.

## Webpack Import

Webpack will transform out import statements in the source JavaScript file into the set of files themselves, all within the output file.

1. `npm install` is run on the command line. The package files are stored in the `node_modules` directory.
2. The `webpack` command is run on the command line.
3. Webpack reads an `import` statement in the source `script.js` file.
4. Webpack, based on the `import` statement in the source `script.js` file gets all of the relevant javascript from `node_modules`- if the package includes other packages, it gets those too.
5. The full file is written out into the `dist` directory.
6. At some later point the server is started with `node index.js`. A request is made to the server.
7. Etc.

## Install a Front-end Package

```text
npm install cat-names
```

Import the package in the source file:

#### src/script.js

```text
import catNames from 'cat-names';
```

Run Webpack

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

### `dist/script.js`

Look in the generated script file. The imported JavaScript will be in this single file, as well as all of this package's dependencies.

You can't install just any package. Try to install `pg` and `import` it into your `script.js` file.
