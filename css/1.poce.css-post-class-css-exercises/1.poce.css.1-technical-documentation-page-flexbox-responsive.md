# CSS.POCE.1: Flexbox Docs Page

## Instructions

1. Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp).
2. We will create the same technical documentation page [here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL). This version is responsive:
   1. Mobile-first is stacked vertically.
   2. Desktop layout is 2 column.
3. Use the advanced properties of Flexbox, including `flex-wrap`, `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`.
   1. For reference, see RA's code example [here](https://codepen.io/awongh-sandwich/pen/XWjvrQJ).
   2. Copy the example into the starter code. Play with the example above to understand how it works. What happens when we take off `flex-wrap` in different screen widths? What about `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`?
