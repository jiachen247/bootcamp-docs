# 1.6: Reading Documentation

## Introduction

Due to the wide scope of material in Coding Bootcamp, Google searching will become more important to solve problems and bugs. Students will be expected to become more independent in development of programming projects.

Reading documentation for a given language, framework, or library is crucial to development. It takes practice and will feel awkward when starting out. As you gain more experience you will create your own strategies for how to find and absorb different types of documentation in order to solve a given problem.

## Exercise

1. Read an intro to developer documentation [here](http://cassandrawilcox.me/beginners-guide-developer-documentation/).
2. Look up the documentation for the JavaScript [Date object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) \(You can also google around for the answer\).
3. Create a new copy of the [starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-starter-code) Create a button that displays today's date when clicked.
