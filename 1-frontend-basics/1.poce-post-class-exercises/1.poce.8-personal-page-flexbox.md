# 1.POCE.8: Personal Page - Flexbox

This exercise is a summation of the responsive layout and flexbox material so far. We'll make a fully responsive page using flexbox and media queries \(in addition to display and margin, etc.\).

## Instructions

Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp).

We will create the same personal page as in [Module 1.1: HTML & CSS](../1.1-html-and-css/#html-css-exercise-personal-page).

Use flexbox and media queries to achieve the responsive behaviour in the [sample page.](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG)

Begin with the mobile layout first and use media queries to apply layout styles needed for the larger layout sizes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For mobile first layouts we need to add the scaling tag in the head. Read more about the `viewport` tag [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag)

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
{% endhint %}
