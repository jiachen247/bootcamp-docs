# 1.1.5: Responsive Design

## Introduction

"Responsive design" describes web designs that change layout depending on the width of the screen \(e.g. mobile vs desktop\). Most responsive design is implemented with CSS media queries.

When developing responsive webpages, develop the mobile layout first because the mobile layout typically has fewer parts. Then develop the tablet and desktop versions which, because of the increased screen real-estate, usually adds to the design. It is more difficult to go the other way around, because using CSS to take things out of the narrower mobile view is harder than putting them into the wider desktop view.
