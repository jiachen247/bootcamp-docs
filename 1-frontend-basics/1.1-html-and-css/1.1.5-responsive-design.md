# 1.1.5: Responsive Design

## Introduction

"Responsive design" describes web designs that change layout depending on the width of the screen \(e.g. mobile vs desktop\). Most responsive design is implemented with CSS media queries.

When developing responsive webpages, consider developing the mobile page first because the mobile page typically has fewer elements. Then develop the tablet and desktop versions which may have more elements. It is more difficult to go the other way around, because we may find it hard to fit all elements in tablet or desktop views into a mobile view.
