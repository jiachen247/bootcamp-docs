# 1.1.7: Bootstrap

## Introduction

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open-source CSS library created at Twitter and [open-sourced in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_%28front-end_framework%29). It provides a set of styles for a 12-column grid, and CSS and JS for common UI elements, such as carousels and alert boxes.

## Bootstrap Tips

1. If using Bootstrap, avoid naming custom classes the same as Bootstrap classes to prevent conflicts.
