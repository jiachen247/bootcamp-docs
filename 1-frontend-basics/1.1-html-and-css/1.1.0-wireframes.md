# 1.1.0: Wireframes

## Introduction

![](../../.gitbook/assets/profilewireframe.png)

In this course we'll be using a visual tool called a wireframe. This is a blueprint-type graphic that represents certain design functionalities of a website page \(or any other digital app screen\) without bothering with any visual design such as colors or images. All companies that do any user facing design use wireframes as a tool to discuss what needs to be built before the visual design phase has started.

During this course we'll be using wireframes not just for HTML and CSS but also to specify the layout of a given exercise. See more about wireframes [here](https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-wireframing/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe).
