# Display

display is the first css style property we'll talk about that actually affects the layout of elements on the page. To begin with we'll talk about the basic layout display values: inline, block and inline-block.

See a full list of all possible display values here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)

## Block vs Inline

display is set by default for every element, either to inline or block.

Here are some example default display values:

| Element Name | Default Display Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| h1, h2, etc. | block |
| p | block |
| section | block |
| a | inline |
| span | inline |

#### Block

block display value means that there is a line break before and after the element. By default that element fills out all the horizontal space.

#### Inline

Inline elements wrap text within the element, spreading the element across more than one line. The end of an inline element does not cause a line break.
