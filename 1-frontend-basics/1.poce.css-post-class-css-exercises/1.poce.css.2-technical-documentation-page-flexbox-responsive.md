# 1.POCE.CSS.2: Flexbox Docs Page

## Instructions

1. Begin with the starter code repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-css-bootcamp).
2. We will create the same technical documentation page as in [Module 1.1: HTML & CSS](../1.1-html-and-css/#html-css-exercise-technical-documentation-page). This version is different in 2 ways.
   1. Mobile-first and responsive
   2. Use Flexbox for desktop layout
3. Use the advanced properties of Flexbox, including `flex-wrap`, `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`.
   1. For reference, see RA's code example [here](https://codepen.io/awongh-sandwich/pen/XWjvrQJ).
   2. Copy the example into the starter code. Play with the example above to understand how it works. What happens when we take off `flex-wrap` in different screen widths? What about `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`?
4. Read more about Flexbox [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and about `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` styles [here](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-flex-grow-flex-shrink-and-flex-basis/).
