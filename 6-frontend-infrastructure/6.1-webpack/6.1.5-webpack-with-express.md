# 6.1.5: Webpack with Express

## Introduction

Now that we can write frontend JS in ES6 with Webpack, let's incorporate Express to serve our frontend JS to browsers. This module describes how to implement Webpack with Express how to deploy this setup to Heroku.

The instructions in this module refer to the `webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp` example repo [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/tree/full-example). There are two branches in this repo: `main` and `full-example`. `main` contains the base starter code, and `full-example` contains a full app with migrations and seed. This module refers to the `full-example` branch.

## Configure Webpack and Express

### Refactor Webpack Config Files

We have split our original `webpack.config.js` into 3 files: common, dev, and prod. We have also put these files into a folder called `webpack_conf` for organisation purposes. Most of the config is in the common file, and dev and prod-environment-specific configs are in dev and prod files respectively. Dev and prod files reference the common file.

1. webpack_conf/webpack.common.js
2. webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js
3. webpack_conf/webpack.prod.js

### Add Node Scripts to Run Webpack

Previously we ran Webpack directly from the command line. Now we will encapsulate Webpack commands in Node scripts defined in `package.json` for convenience and so that Heroku can run Webpack. By default, Heroku looks for Node scripts called `build` and `start` to execute Node applications deployed to Heroku. Define the following scripts in `package.json`.

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --config webpack_conf/webpack.prod.js"
  "start": "node index.mjs",
  "watch": "webpack --watch --config webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js",
},
```

1. `build` compiles our application with Heroku into a "build" for production environments.
2. `start` starts our server.
3. `watch` compiles our application for development environments, and auto-recompiles the application according to the specification in `webpack.dev.js`. In our example, `webpack.dev.js` tells Webpack to recompile the application when we have changed files in `src`.

### Retain `src` and `dist` File Structure for Webpack

Note that our file structure remains the same from previous Webpack modules. There is still a `src` folder for our JS and SASS code that we want Webpack to compile, and a `dist` folder that contains Webpack-compiled files and other files that we may want to expose to the client, such as `main.html`. Our Express `index.mjs` is configured to expose files in `dist` publicly.

### Update Webpack Config to Hash Compiled File Names

Browsers typically cache client-side code, and if we update our client-side code without updating file names, browsers may believe they already have the latest code \(based on the unchanged file name\) and not retrieve updated code from the server.

Update our Webpack config to add hashes to the names of Webpack-compiled files to ensure browsers always retrieve the latest code from our servers. Henceforth, every time we run Webpack to compile files, the compiled file names will be different. This will "break the cache" of the browser to make the browser retrieve fresh file contents on page load.

Read more about browser file caching and caching headers [here](https://medium.com/@codebyamir/a-web-developers-guide-to-browser-caching-cc41f3b73e7c).

#### webpack_conf/webpack.common.js

The following code is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.common.js#L13).

```javascript
const path = require('path');
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: './src/index.js',
  },
  plugins: [new MiniCssExtractPlugin()],
  output: {
    filename: '[name]-[contenthash].bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          {
            loader: 'css-loader',
          },
          'sass-loader',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Configure Base HTML File with Express

In previous modules we created a `dist/main.html` file to load our JS to our browsers. Let's connect this file to Express so that Express can serve this file. Notice we are making less use of EJS and more use of DOM code that is injected via a single HTML file. This is a pattern that we will see more of as we move into React in Module 7.

#### dist/main.html

This file is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/src/index.html).

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-giJF6kkoqNQ00vy+HMDP7azOuL0xtbfIcaT9wjKHr8RbDVddVHyTfAAsrekwKmP1"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
      integrity="sha384-ygbV9kiqUc6oa4msXn9868pTtWMgiQaeYH7/t7LECLbyPA2x65Kgf80OJFdroafW"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

#### webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js

Configure Webpack to move `main.html` from `src` to `dist`. The following code is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js).

```javascript
const merge = require('webpack-merge');
const common = require('./webpack.common.js');
const path = require('path');

const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = merge(common, {
  entry: {
    main: './src/index.js',
  },
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  watch: true,
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|mjs|jsx)$/, // regex to see which files to run babel on
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      // name this file main, so that it does not get automatically requested as a static file
      filename: './main.html',
      template: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'src', 'main.html'),
    }),
  ].filter(Boolean),
});
```

#### routes.mjs

Instruct Express to serve `main.html` for the `/home` route. The following code is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/routes.mjs#L12).

```javascript
import { resolve } from 'path';
import db from './models/index.mjs';
import initItemsController from './controllers/items.mjs';

export default function bindRoutes(app) {
  const ItemsController = initItemsController(db);

  app.get('/items', ItemsController.index);

  // special JS page. Include the webpack main.html file
  app.get('/home', (request, response) => {
    response.sendFile(resolve('dist', 'main.html'));
  });
}
```

## Developing Express Apps with Webpack Locally

To develop Express apps with Webpack, we want our Express apps to auto-reload when we change our code so that we can quickly test our changes. Previously we had been using just `nodemon`, but now there is an extra Webpack compilation step that we will automate with Webpack's "watch" feature, in the Node `watch` script we wrote above in `package.json`.

While developing Express apps with Webpack, have 2 terminals open, 1 running `nodemon index.mjs` and another running `npm run watch`. The former will reload our Express apps on changes, and the latter will re-run Webpack on changes in `src`.

## Deploying to Heroku

We have configured Express to work with Heroku by adding `build` and `start` scripts to `package.json`. In our example repo we have also configured Sequelize to work with Heroku by adding a production database config and updating `models/index.mjs` to support production environments.

### Add Production Database Config

We added a production environment database config to `config/config.js`.

#### config/config.js

The following code is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/config/config.js).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  development: {
    username: '<YOUR_USERNAME>',
    password: null,
    database: 'webp_items_development',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    dialect: 'postgres',
  },
  production: {
    use_env_variable: 'DATABASE_URL',
    dialect: 'postgres',
    protocol: 'postgres',
    dialectOptions: {
      ssl: {
        // https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/12083
        require: true,
        rejectUnauthorized: false,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Configure `models/index.mjs` to Support Production Environment

#### models/index.mjs

Initialise Sequelize with the `DATABASE_URL` env var provided by Heroku. The following code is in GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/models/index.mjs).

```javascript
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize';
import url from 'url';
import allConfig from '../config/config.js';

const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = allConfig[env];
const db = {};
let sequelize;

// If env is production, retrieve database auth details from the
// DATABASE_URL env var that Heroku provides us
if (env === 'production') {
  // Break apart the Heroku database url and rebuild the configs we need
  const { DATABASE_URL } = process.env;
  const dbUrl = url.parse(DATABASE_URL);
  const username = dbUrl.auth.substr(0, dbUrl.auth.indexOf(':'));
  const password = dbUrl.auth.substr(
    dbUrl.auth.indexOf(':') + 1,
    dbUrl.auth.length
  );
  const dbName = dbUrl.path.slice(1);
  const host = dbUrl.hostname;
  const { port } = dbUrl;
  config.host = host;
  config.port = port;
  sequelize = new Sequelize(dbName, username, password, config);
}

// If env is not production, retrieve DB auth details from the config
else {
  sequelize = new Sequelize(
    config.database,
    config.username,
    config.password,
    config
  );
}

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

export default db;
```

### Build

When we push to Heroku, Heroku automatically runs `npm run build` and `npm start`. Run `npm run build` on the command line to observe what happens: Webpack compiles files into the `dist` folder.

### Add `dist` Folder to .gitignore

We do not want to commit our `dist` files to GitHub. This is because `dist` will contain imported code from `node_modules`, code that can be re-installed with `npm i` and re-Webpack-ed with Webpack on-demand. There is no need to store it in GitHub and bloat our repo. See `dist` in `.gitignore` on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp/blob/full-example/.gitignore#L7).
