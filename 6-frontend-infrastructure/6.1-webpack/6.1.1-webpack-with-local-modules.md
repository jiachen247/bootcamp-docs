# 6.1.1: Webpack with Local Modules

## Introduction

Pre-compiling front-end code with Webpack affords secondary benefits, including ability to use `import` statements. `import` gives us a few benefits.

1. Import gives us finer-grained control about how our code is run. Previously, the order of HTML `script` tags determined the order of the JavaScript code execution.
2. Each imported module is a separate namespace from others- the files do not interact unless explicitly programmed to.
3. In [Module 6.1.2: Webpack with NPM Modules](6.1.2-webpack-with-npm-modules.md) we will learn how to use 3rd-party NPM libraries which can be imported using `import`.

Webpack claims its main feature is "module bundling". Read more about this functionality here: [https://webpack.js.org/concepts/](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Webpack Import Order of Events

Webpack will transform our source JS files connected by import statements into a single output file that contains all dependencies that the imports reference.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/webpack-import-2.jpg)

1. The `webpack` command is run.
2. Webpack reads an `import` statement in the source `script.js` file.
3. Based on the `import`, Webpack retrieves all dependency code. If the imported module depends on other modules, Webpack retrieves those modules too.
4. Webpack writes the compiled file into the `dist` directory.
5. The server is started with `node index.js`. A request is made to the server. The server responds with the compiled JS file in `dist`.

## Webpack Import Example

### Initialise Project Folder

Create new folder and install Webpack.

```text
mkdir import-webpack-demo
cd import-webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

Create folders and files that Webpack will use for compilation.

```text
mkdir src dist
touch src/script.js
touch src/case.js
touch dist/main.html
```

#### src/case.js

Populate `case.js` with the below code. Webpack will compile this file into `script.js` because `script.js` imports `case.js`.

```javascript
export function camel(input) {
  return input.split(' ').join('_');
}

export function scream(input) {
  return input.toUpperCase();
}
```

#### src/script.js

Populate `script.js` with the below code. Notice the file imports `case.js`.

```javascript
import { camel } from './case.js';

const component = () => {
  // make a container
  const div = document.createElement('div');

  // display element
  const span = document.createElement('span');

  // input
  const input = document.createElement('input');

  // on change, display in the span
  input.addEventListener('change', function () {
    // use the imported code
    span.innerText = camel(input.value);
  });

  div.appendChild(input);
  div.appendChild(span);

  return div;
};

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

#### dist/main.html

Populate a `main.html` file that will load Webpack's transformed `script.js`.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Configure Webpack

#### webpack.config.js

Create a file that tells Webpack what to transform and how.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/script.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'script.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```

### Run Webpack

Transform `src/script.js` into `dist/script.js`. Notice we now use `--mode=production` instead of `--mode=none` from [Module 6.1](./#run-webpack). More on production mode in the next section.

```text
npx webpack --mode=production
```

Observe the imported JS from `case.js` will also be in the generated `script.js`. To see a formatted version of the generated file, install the [Beautify plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify). Notice how Webpack chose to format the final version of the code. Notice the 2nd function in `case.js` is not in the generated `script.js`.

Make changes to our source code and observe how it affects the distribution code when we run Webpack again.

### Production Mode

The `production` mode option for Webpack CLI tells Webpack to use specific "production" transformations. Read how to use `mode` [here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/). Read what "production" mode enables [here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/#usage).

For instance, one benefit of production mode is that it enables "_module concatenation_", an optimization that helps our bundled dependencies execute faster. Read more [here](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/).

We will rarely need to configure Webpack from scratch, because usually someone on the team has done it already. No need to understand all the details of Webpack configuration at the moment.
