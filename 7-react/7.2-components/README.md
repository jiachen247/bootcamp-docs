# 7.2: Components

React components are parts of the UI that are specified in JSX. They can be composed together to form an entire app.

The word _component_ refers to the React code syntax, but it also refers to the concept of a UI design element that repeats itself across different parts of an app. Most modern web applications, for reasons of ease-of-use and design reusability, have parts that are repeated in more than one place in a page and for multiple pages.
