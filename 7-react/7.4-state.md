# 7.4: State

State is the main keyword used in the React library that denotes DOM manipulation.

When we run the ReactDOM render function React manipulates the DOM, but in the React system this only happens once, when the page loads.

Over the life of the React app in the browser, _state_ is the word that describes the data that React uses to change the DOM as the user makes actions.

### Events

Before we cover using dynamic data inside of a React component we'll cover the way to specify an event listener callback in React.

```jsx
<button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
```

Take a look at the full list of React listener attributes here: [https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html\#supported-events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events)

Note that in this example we are specifying the callback function _inside_ the component function. This is not something we would normally do, but in React all the functionalities of a component are contained and defined inside.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let count = 0;

  const incrementCount = (event) => {
    count += 1;

    console.log(`current value of count is: ${count}`);
  };

  console.log('counter function component');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When this code runs, it may not work as you expected. We specified the output of the count variable on line 18. Clicking the button triggers the callback, and the value of count variable changes, but the value on screen never does.

In order to get React to actually manipulate the DOM we have to use the React library itself.

### `useState`

The React system for manipulating the DOM is called hooks. There is an older system of class components that was used before hooks was released in Feb. 2019.

The hooks function useState is a React function that returns 2 things.

* a variable representing the state value
* a function that updates this value

The argument to the `useState` function is the starting state value. In the example below `count` begins as `0`.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = (event) => {
    console.log(`current value of count is: ${count}`);

    // call the hooks function when we want to manipulate the DOM.
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  console.log('counter function component');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

When you run this code note a few things:

* `count` is updated on the screen!
* the `console.log` on line 13 happens every time the counter gets updated

When you call the state hook function react takes the value and calls the component function again. But this time it knows the value of the variable you passed in. The variable and hook function are related from when you first created them with `useState`. The function renders the JSX with the new value and React puts it on screen.

## Nested Components

When data is passed into a child component, React calls all the child components as well.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Fahrenheit({ temperature }) {
  console.log('inside fahrenheit component');

  return (
    <p>
      {temperature} in fahrenheit is: {(temperature * 9) / 5 + 32}
    </p>
  );
}

function BigWord() {
  console.log('running big word');

  return <h1>HELLO</h1>;
}

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = (event) => {
    console.log(`current value of count is: ${count}`);

    // call the hooks function when we want to manipulate the DOM.
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log('counter function component');
  };

  console.log('counter function component');

  return (
    <div>
      <BigWord />
      <Fahrenheit temperature={count} />
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
