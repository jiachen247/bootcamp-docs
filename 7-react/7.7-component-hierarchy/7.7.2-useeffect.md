# 7.7.2: useEffect

`useEffect` allows you to initialize your component with behaviours, or trigger code every time the component gets re-rendered.

The official React documentation states that useEffect is for component actions with _side-effects_. That is, something that is not a direct result of manipulating any state data. There are many different specific uses for useEffect, such as DOM library rendering, setInterval, state monitoring and more.

We are going to optimize our ecommerce app by having the list of items load automatically when the `App` component loads.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  axios.get('/items').then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    setItems(result.data.items);
  });
}, []);
```

The code above says, run the effect callback once when the component has finished rendering the first time. Inside the callback we make the same request, and set state when the request comes back.

## Skip Effects

`useEffect` runs each time the component re-renders. If we want to limit this behaviour we can set an array of things to listen for updates to. When those things change, React will run the `useEffect` again. In the case above we never want it to run again, so we can pass an empty array.

## Caveats

React side-effects are serious matters. [React advises that you probably don't need useEffect](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1281669881667162112?s=20) and that many times passing data around is sufficient to get the same behaviour.
