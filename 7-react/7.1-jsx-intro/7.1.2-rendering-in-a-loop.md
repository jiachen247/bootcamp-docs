# 7.1.2: Rendering in a Loop

React strongly urges the use of the map function to create elements in a loop.

Remember that map is the function that takes an array and runs a function to transform an element into something else to every element.

In this case we are taking an array of data and creating an array of react elements.

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) => <li>{number}</li>);
```

## Missing Key

React will complain that your elements don't havew a unique key attribute. Here is the code to add it:

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) => (
  <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
));
```
