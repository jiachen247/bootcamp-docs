# 7.3: Express.js + Webpack + React

## 7.4: Express.js + Webpack + React

Full-stack React setup with Express.js.

Begin with the base React Express repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp)

This repo has a few new react-specific features built in.

## App.jsx

The structure of our React app will begin with two files.

### index.js

`index.js` contains the root node we create and mentions the `document` variable. There will be little to no changes to this file while writing the app, except maybe to `import` another Sass file.

### App.jsx

`App.jsx` contains the actual React app. This structure is for the Fast Refresh \(described below\) but is also to completely separate the code mentioning the `document` variable from the actual React code.

## Fast Refresh

Fast Refresh is the library that allows React to reload a component and also conserve it's state at the same time.

The Webpack dev config has been changed to add the appropriate libraries: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp/blob/main/webpack_conf/webpack.dev.js)

## Watch

We are getting rid of the `watch` command to run Webpack, and have integrated it into Express.

In `index.mjs` we detect `development` state and start the Webpack watcher from within Express.
