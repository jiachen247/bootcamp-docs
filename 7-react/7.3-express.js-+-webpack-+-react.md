# 7.3: Express.js + Webpack + React

## Introduction

In this module we will set up a full-stack React app with Express.js. Begin with the base React Express repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp). This repo has a few new React-specific features built-in.

## File Structure

The structure of our React app will begin with two files.

### index.js

`index.js` contains the root node we create and mentions the `document` variable. There will be little to no changes to this file while writing the app, except maybe to `import` another Sass file.

### App.jsx

`App.jsx` contains the React app. This structure is to enable Fast Refresh \(described below\) but is also to completely separate the code mentioning the `document` variable from the actual React code for modularity.

## Fast Refresh

Fast Refresh is the library that allows React to reload a component and preserve its state at the same time. We have changed the Webpack dev config to add the appropriate libraries.

## Remove Watch

We have removed the `watch` command to run Webpack, and have integrated watch functionality into Express. In `index.mjs` we detect that we are in the `development` environment and start the Webpack watcher from within Express.
