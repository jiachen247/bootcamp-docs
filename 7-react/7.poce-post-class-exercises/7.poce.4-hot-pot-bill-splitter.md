Create an app that will split the your hot pot bill between friends.

## Base

A person can be added into a list of people.

Items and their price can be added into a list of items.

When an item is added each person who wanted that item can be added onto the list of people for that item.

At the end the app calculates the number each person is responsible for paying.

Create at least three components, `Form`, `ItemList` and `SplitCalculator`. The illustration above suggests some further components and also says where certain data in the app must be stored. The main data, the list of people and the list of items \(which will also contain the associated people\) must be state of the top-level `App` component.
