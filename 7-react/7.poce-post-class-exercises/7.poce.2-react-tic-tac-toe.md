# 7.POCE.2: React Tic Tac Toe

## Setup

Begin with the [base React repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp).

## Base

Create a playable game of tic tac toe in React. Switch between players automatically. The game ends when all squares are filled.

The board should be represented in a state variable using `useState`.

### Creating the Board

When creating the click events for the board, use `map` with `index` and inline anonymous functions so that a callback function can know the rows and columns.

#### map with index

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];
const doubled = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);
  return num * 2;
});
```

#### `map` with inline callback

Note that on line 18 we specify a click event callback. When creating the tic tac toe game grid, use a similar syntax so that the game square click callback knows the position of the square that was clicked. In the context of a tic tac toe board data structure, `index` would represent a row or column.

```jsx
// a function that uses the index
const saySomething = (num, index) => {
  alert(`${num} : ${index}`);
};

// array to use with map
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];

// create a button for each number
const buttons = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);

  // when the button gets clicked define an
  // anon func. In the func call saySomething
  // pass saySomething the index
  return (
    <button
      onClick={(event) => {
        saySomething(num, index);
      }}
    >
      {num}
    </button>
  );
});
```

## Comfortable

#### Reset

Create a button to reset the game.

#### Game Over

See if the game is won when a click happens.

#### Dynamic Board Size

Create a dropdown that allows the user to select the size of the board.

## More Comfortable

Create a computer player.
