# 7.POCE.2: React Tic Tac Toe

## Setup

Begin with the [base React repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp).

## Base

Create a playable game of tic tac toe in React. Switch between players automatically. The game ends when all squares are filled.

The board should be represented in a state variable using `useState`.

Don't use nested components for this game. Code everything in the `App` component.

### Creating the Board

When creating the click events for the board, use `map` with `index` and inline anonymous functions so that a callback function can know the rows and columns.

#### map with index

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];
const doubled = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);
  return num * 2;
});
```

#### `map` with inline callback

Note that on line 18 we specify a click event callback. When creating the tic tac toe game grid, use a similar syntax so that the game square click callback knows the position of the square that was clicked. In the context of a tic tac toe board data structure, `index` would represent a row or column.

```jsx
// a function that uses the index
const saySomething = (num, index) => {
  alert(`${num} : ${index}`);
};

// array to use with map
const numbers = [4, 6, 8, 9];

// create a button for each number
const buttons = numbers.map((num, index) => {
  console.log(num, index);

  // when the button gets clicked define an
  // anon func. In the func call saySomething
  // pass saySomething the index
  return (
    <button
      onClick={(event) => {
        saySomething(num, index);
      }}
    >
      {num}
    </button>
  );
});
```

#### Board Data Structure

We'll use a nested array to represent the board and use this data structure in state to update the DOM.

Here is an example of what that data structure might look like \(pseudocode\).

```jsx
[
    ['','',''],
    ['','',''],
    ['','',''],
]
```

#### Nested Maps

In order to iterate over this data structure a nested map will be needed to build the elements.

```jsx
// array to use with map
const numbers = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];

const rows = numbers.map((row, rowIndex) => {
  // row is one *unnested* array
  const buttons = row.map((num, colIndex) => (<button>{num}</button>));
  return (<div>
    {buttons}
  </div>);
});

// rows is an array of div *elements* that have 3 buttons inside.
console.log( rows );
```

## Comfortable

#### Reset

Create a button to reset the game.

#### Game Over

See if the game is won when a click happens.

#### Dynamic Board Size

Create a dropdown that allows the user to select the size of the board.

## More Comfortable

Create a computer player.
