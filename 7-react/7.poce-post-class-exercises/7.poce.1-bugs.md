# 7.POCE.1: Bugs

Render an array of objects using JSX.

## Setup

Begin with the base Webpack repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1.git](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1.git)

Follow the instructions in [7.1 JSX](../7.1-jsx-intro/) to set Webpack up for React. 

Copy the contents of [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/swe1-docs/master/fixture-data/bugs.json) into `index.js`. \(You can also make a module for this data if you want\).

## Base

Render the data in the array onto the screen.

The HTML should look like this:

```text
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>id: 1</p>
        <p>problem: Use the back-end PCI panel, then you can copy the 1080p card!</p>
        <p>error text: We need to override the auxiliary PNG pixel!</p>

        <p>user email: Julien.Windler@yahoo.com</p>
        <p>feature: alarm-calculate</p>
    </li>
    [...]
</ul>
```

## Comfortable

Install [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) and format the dates to [time from now. ](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)

Use CSS so that each of the features is colored the same color.
