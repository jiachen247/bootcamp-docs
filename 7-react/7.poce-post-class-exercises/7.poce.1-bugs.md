# 7.POCE.1: Bugs

Render an array of objects using JSX.

## Setup

Begin with the base Webpack repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1.git](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-swe1.git)

Follow the instructions in [7.1 JSX](../7.1-jsx-intro/) to set Webpack up for React. 

Copy the contents of [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/swe1-docs/master/fixture-data/bugs.json) into `index.js`. \(You can also make a module for this data if you want\).

## Base

Render the data in the array onto the screen.

The HTML should look like this:

```text
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>id: 1</p>
        <p>problem: </p>
        <p>error text: The Apollotech B340 is an affordable wireless mouse with reliable connectivity, 12 months battery life and modern design</p>
        <p>created: 2020-12-28T09:02:15.112Z</p>
        <p>updated: 2020-12-28T09:02:15.112Z</p>
        <p>user email: </p>
        <p>feature: </p>
    </li>
    [...]
</ul>
```

Note that the above _**is not code**_, only pseudocode demonstrating the component nesting.

## Comfortable

Install [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) and format the dates to [time from now. ](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)

Use CSS so that each of the features is colored the same color.
