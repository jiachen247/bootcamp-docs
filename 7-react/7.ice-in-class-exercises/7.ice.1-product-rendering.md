# 7.ICE.1: Product Rendering

Render an array of objects using JSX.

## Setup

Begin with the base Webpack repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/rocketacademy/webpack-mvc-base-bootcamp.git)

Follow the instructions in [7.1 JSX](../7.1-jsx-intro/) to set Webpack up for React.

Copy the contents of [this JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/bootcamp-docs/master/fixture-data/products.json) into `App.jsx`. \(You can also make a module for this data if you want\).

## Base

Render the data in the array onto the screen. The HTML should look like this:

```markup
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>id: 1</p>
        <p>name: Car</p>
        <p>description: The Apollotech B340 is an affordable wireless mouse with reliable connectivity, 12 months battery life and modern design</p>
        <p>created: 2020-12-28T09:02:15.112Z</p>
        <p>updated: 2020-12-28T09:02:15.112Z</p>
    </li>
    [...]
</ul>
```

## Comfortable

Install [Moment.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) and format the dates to [time from now. ](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/)

Use CSS so that the background color of the items alternate between white and grey.
