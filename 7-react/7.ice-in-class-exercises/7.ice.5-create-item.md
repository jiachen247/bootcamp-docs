# 7.ICE.5: Create Item

Begin with the example ecommerce React app: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-ecom-bootcamp)

Add a special "admin" column / component to the app layout. This one has a form that adds an item. Create inputs for each item field and use axios to submit a post request to the server.

On the server create a controller that accepts the POST request and creates a new row in the items table. Send the newly created item back to the client.

When the client React app receives the new item, push the item into the list of items.
