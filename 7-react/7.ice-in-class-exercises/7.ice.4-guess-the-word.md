# 7.ICE.4: Guess the Word

Create a game of guess the word.

## Setup

Begin with the [base react repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-swe1)

## Base

Hardcode a secret word to guess: banana.

Create a controlled form in which the user can only type one letter as a guess.

If the user guesses correctly, add the letter to the correctly guessed letters.

Display the guessed letters' positions on the screen.

For each wrong guess the program adds to the figure: \(凸 ಠ 益 ಠ\)凸 

The player can only guess wrong 7 times before the game ends. \(the number of characters in the figure\)

Note: code only in the `App` component. No need to make child components of `App`.
