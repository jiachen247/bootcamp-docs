# 7.ICE.3: React Cards

Create a game of cards using React.

## Setup

Begin with the [base react repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/react-express-base-bootcamp)

### Card Helper Functions

Copy the `shuffleCards` and `makeDeck` functions from [1.5 High Card](../../1-frontend-basics/1.5-high-card-dom.md).

Paste them into the `App.jsx` file \(or create a module for them\).

### Card Game Data

Copy the `App` component starter code below into `App.jsx`. The code initializes the card deck state array variable and deals cards into a player hand.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  // set the default value of the deck
  const [cards, setCards] = useState(shuffleCards(makeDeck()));

  // set the default player hand as empty
  const [playerHand, setPlayerHand] = useState([]);

  // create the deal button click handler
  const dealCards = () => {
    const hand = [cards.pop(), cards.pop()];
    setPlayerHand(hand);
    setCards([...cards]);
  };

  // render the cards in the hand
  // note that when this renders the first time and the hand is
  // empty, it doesnt require and special condition
  const handEls = playerHand.map(({ name, suit }) => (
    <div>
      {name}
      {suit}
    </div>
  ));

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>cards:</h3>
        {handEls}
      </div>
      <p>
        <button onClick={dealCards}>deal</button>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Base

Create a game of high card.

## Comfortable

### Play Hand

Change the game to add a Play Hand button.

The user can continue to deal cards to themselves. When they click the Play Hand button the computer is dealt the same amount of cards in the the player hand, and the highest card in either hand wins.

The game ends when the deck is out of cards. When the deck is out of cards, reset the game to the starting values.

## More Comfortable

Add a score to the game when the deck runs out of cards. The player who had more winning hands gets one point.
