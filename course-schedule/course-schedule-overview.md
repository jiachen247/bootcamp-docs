# Course Schedule Overview

## Introduction

The SWE1 schedule is organised in folders representing 4 weeks each, each with a page representing each week. Each week's page lists deliverables for each day of the course. Deliverables typically consist of videos, reading, and coding exercises.

Each day's deliverables are due by the **start** of that day's class. We will complete exercises based on each day's deliverables in pairs during class.
