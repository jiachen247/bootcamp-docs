# Course Days

## Introduction

RA doesn't hold class on public holidays. To cater for public holidays, we can't plan course content strictly around week and day numbers, for example always teach Intro to Express on Week 3 Day 2. Thus we have Course Days, which map course material to numbered days, and map Course Days to a unique schedule for each batch that works around public holidays.
