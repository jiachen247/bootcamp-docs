# Weeks 9-12: Full Stack Application

## **Complete Full Stack App with PostgreSQL**

Our app now serves complete HTML pages representing dynamic data inside our SQL database. We'll enhance the functionality of our app by adding front-end JS back into our stack.

We'll refactor our app so that it's more well-structured and easier to work on.

Front-end JS, Express file server, AJAX

Model View Controller app refactor, SQL DB ORM - Sequelize, REST APIs
