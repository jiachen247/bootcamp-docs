# Project 5: Group React App

Build a full-stack app in a team setting.

This project will incorporate group work into building a complete full-stack React app.

The required technologies are not any different from the previous project, although it is heavily reccomended to implement a reduce/context store for the data in the React app.

The backend should be derived the same standard Express MVC  app: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-swe1)

Remember that you need to add CORS to this repo.

## Requirements

The app must fulfill the following requirements.

* Use React
* Use AJAX to get and set data from the server
* At least 1 full set of CRUD routes \(create, retrieve, update, delete\)
* At least 2 SQL tables
* At least 1 one-to-many and 1 many-to-many SQL relationship
* Use CSS

The app must be complete in the sense that it cannot rely on the theoretical existence of another system, e.g. an API that doesn't exist. Any 3rd-party APIs available on the internet can be used, e.g. NPM libraries.

Any seed data your app would need to run needs to be included in the repo. The final version of the app must be populated with data that looks at least semi-realistic. For example, a social media app would have more than 1 post, 1 comment and 1 like in the system.



## Project Timeline

### Summary

| Day of Week | Course Day | Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mon | CD82 | Ideation Phase 1. Introduce Project 4, post project ideas in Slack for feedback |
| Fri | CD86 | Deadline to post project ideas in Slack |
| Mon | CD87 | Ideation Phase 2. Create planning docs: user-flow diagram, DB ERD, and wireframes |
| Tue | CD88 | Finalise project idea and share planning docs in GitHub repo over Slack. Instructors will review planning docs over Slack. |
| Mon | CD92 | Finish core functionality \(MVP\). Users should be able to perform the primary user story. Please deploy your app to Heroku before feature freeze on Thursday. 30-minute mid-point check-in with instructor. |
| Wed | CD94 | Feature freeze. No more developing new app functionality. Use remaining time to focus on polish, i.e. fixing UI/UX, refactoring code. 30-minute review with instructor. Instructor to complete code review for feedback by Thursday. |
| Mon | CD97 | Project presentations. 60-minute post-mortem with instructor. |
| Wed | CD99 | Project Video Due |

### Ideation Phase 1

Brainstorm app ideas. What problem does the app solve, for whom? How does the app solve the problem? What data does the app handle?

### Ideation Phase 2

Plan the app implementation. Create planning docs: a [user-flow diagram](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/), database ERD, and wireframes. Save these planning docs in a project GitHub repo and share it in Slack. Instructors will review these planning documents with you before you begin implementation.

### Post-Mortem Meeting

Please answer [these questions](../course-logistics/course-methodology.md#instructor-code-review) before the post-mortem meeting with the instructor. This meeting will be as a group.

## Video Demo

Demo your app in a 2-3 minute video. First and foremost this video should explain what your app does and a demonstration of how a user would actually use the app. As you are demonstrating the app you should be explaining features of the app in the context of what the user wants to accomplish and why they want to accomplish it. The video should not go into any technical details that would be incomprehensible to someone non-technical.

For example, when talking about a react shopping app, when demoing the app, don't talk about how when the button gets clicked that the item moves to the shopping cart column, rather, speak about the process of the user selecting an item they want to buy and ordering it.

#### How to Record the video

Use zoom to record the video locally on your computer. It will record you and your face in the upper right corner. When you are done with the video make it available in the following ways:

* Upload it to YouTube. Embed the video in your project README.md file.
* Put the video file in your project repo and commit the file.
