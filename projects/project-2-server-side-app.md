# Project 2: Server Side App

This app is a culmination of everything that you've learned about server-side web applications.

## Requirements

#### Your app must:

* Have at least 2 SQL tables.
* Have at least 1 full CRUD route \(create, retrieve, update, delete\).
* Render HTML.
* Use CSS.

Your app must be a complete working thing. It cannot rely on the theoretical existence of another system, e.g., "_if I had access to a bank account database system, then my app would...._"

You are responsible for creating any fake data that your app would need to fully run. The final version of your app must be populated to a degree with data that looks at least semi-realistic. A social media app cannot have 1 post, 1 comment and 1 like in the entire system.

Given the relative restrictions of a server-side app that renders HTML pages \(as compared to a modern full-stack app\), there are certain ideas that will be more easily accomplished when we bring in more modern technologies such as:

* User inputted date, time or date range, such as scheduling or calendars.
* User location and using maps.
* Anything involving a typeahead UI.
* Anything where the user might have to drag or draw something.

## App Ideas

In this module we have only covered the general mechanic of a web application that stores, changes and retrieves data using HTTP and HTML. In fact every single service or app on the internet has these properties.

* Google stores website it finds and users search inside that database.
* Uber stores drivers that are available and users ask drivers to pick them up.
* Telegram stores messages between users.
* EBay stores auction data.

That is not to say that the goal of project is to create Google, but that what a web application does is not GET and POST requests- it stores the data involved in it's core functionality \(ride pickup, auctions, search, etc.\).

Your app idea is more compelling if it's use is for something specific and realistic. The best case is if it's actually something you yourself would use.

## Process

This project is about polish, so we expect that half or even a majority of the time spent will be spent after the main features are finished.

Refactoring or rewriting some or most of the app is encouraged. We hope that this code is something that can be proudly demonstrated to a potential employer. \(No last minute spaghetti code\).

Given that, remember that speccing the specific stages and milestones in the project is a really important part of the process. Don't forge ahead without a plan.
