# Project 2: Server-Side App

## Introduction

This app is a culmination of everything we've learned about server-side web applications. It is an open-ended project, meaning you will build something based on your unique needs.

## Requirements

Your app must have the following requirements.

* At least 3 SQL tables
* At least 1 one-to-many and 1 many-to-many SQL relationship
* At least 1 full set of CRUD routes \(create, retrieve, update, delete\)
* Render HTML
* Use CSS

Your app must be complete in the sense that it cannot rely on the theoretical existence of another system, e.g. an API that doesn't exist. You are free to use any 3rd-party APIs available on the internet, e.g. NPM libraries.

You are responsible for any seed data your app would need to run. The final version of your app must be populated with data that looks at least semi-realistic. For example, a social media app would have more than 1 post, 1 comment and 1 like in the system.

Given the relative restrictions of a server-side app that renders HTML pages \(as compared to a modern full-stack app that we will learn in [Module 4](../4-full-stack-application/4.0-module-4-overview.md)\), there are certain ideas that will be more easily accomplished when we bring in more modern technologies such as the following. No worries if you don't have them for now.

* Date or date-time input fields for scheduling or calendars.
* User location using maps.
* Anything involving a [typeahead UI](https://dribbble.com/tags/typeahead).
* Anything where the user might have to drag or draw something.

## App Ideas

In this module we have only covered the general mechanic of a web application that stores, changes and retrieves data using HTTP and HTML. In fact every single service or app on the internet has these properties.

* Google stores website it finds and users search inside that database.
* Uber stores drivers that are available and users ask drivers to pick them up.
* Telegram stores messages between users.
* EBay stores auction data.

That is not to say that the goal of project is to create Google, but that what a web application does is not GET and POST requests- it stores the data involved in it's core functionality \(ride pickup, auctions, search, etc.\).

Your app idea is more compelling if it's use is for something specific and realistic. The best case is if it's actually something you yourself would use.

## Process

This project is about polish, so we expect that half or even a majority of the time spent will be spent after the main features are finished.

Refactoring or rewriting some or most of the app is encouraged. We hope that this code is something that can be proudly demonstrated to a potential employer. \(No last minute spaghetti code\).

Given that, remember that speccing the specific stages and milestones in the project is a really important part of the process. Don't forge ahead without a plan.
