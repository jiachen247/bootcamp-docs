# Project 6: Capstone

## Introduction

This is the capstone project. The objective of this project is to allow you to pursue a specific interest or field and choose your own tech stack based on its applicability or merits, while under the guidance of RA instructors. At the end of this project you should be able to justify the technology choices you've made and understand some of the tradeoffs between the available options. You can choose to work alone or in teams of two.

## Requirements

1. Your app must include unit testing for all non-CRUD logic that happens on the backend. The unit tests should run in continuous integration whenever anyone pushes to the GitHub repo.
2. The app must work without errors.
3. Your app must be complete in the sense that it cannot rely on the theoretical existence of another system, e.g. an API that doesn't exist. You are free to use any 3rd-party APIs available on the internet, e.g. NPM libraries.
4. You are responsible for any seed data your app would need to run without errors. If the app is a web app, the final version must be populated with data that looks at least semi-realistic. For example, a social media app would have more than 1 post, 1 comment and 1 like in the system.

## Ideas

Be creative when thinking about what you want to accomplish in this project.

Do you want to build the perfect Express.js app that has no bugs and beautiful code and amazing CSS? Do you want to write a mobile app that solves some problem that you're passionate about? Do you want to create a React Component NPM package that you think people would want to use?

Take some time to consider what kind of learning outcome and what kind of project you want to produce in the time that you have left at Rocket Academy.

## Project Timeline

TBD

### Ideation Phase 1

Brainstorm app ideas. What problem does the app solve, for whom? How does the app solve the problem? What data does the app handle?

### Ideation Phase 2

Plan the app implementation. Create planning docs: a [user-flow diagram](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-are-user-flows/), database ERD, and wireframes. Save these planning docs in a project GitHub repo and share it in Slack. Instructors will review these planning documents with you before you begin implementation.

### Post-Mortem Meeting

Please answer [these questions](../course-logistics/course-methodology.md#instructor-code-review) before the post-mortem meeting with your instructor.

## Video Demo

Demo your app in a 2-3 minute video. First and foremost this video should explain what your app does and a demonstration of how a user would actually use the app. As you are demonstrating the app you should be explaining features of the app in the context of what the user wants to accomplish and why they want to accomplish it. The video should not go into any technical details that would be incomprehensible to someone non-technical.

For example, when talking about a react shopping app, when demoing the app, don't talk about how when the button gets clicked that the item moves to the shopping cart column, rather, speak about the process of the user selecting an item they want to buy and ordering it.

#### How to Record the Video

Use zoom to record the video locally on your computer. It will record you and your face in the upper right corner. When you are done with the video make it available in the following ways:

* Upload it to YouTube. Embed the video in your project README.md file.
* Put the video file in your project repo and commit the file.
