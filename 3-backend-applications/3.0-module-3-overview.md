# 3.0: Module 3 Overview

## Introduction

In Module 3 we will build apps using the NPM library and web server framework Express, and store data in a SQL database on a separate DB server.

![Our Express app will have this architecture.](../.gitbook/assets/express-4.jpg)

## Architecture

Let's define the back-end and front-end of our app architecture.

### Front End

1. Frontend typically refers to a browser, mobile, or desktop application where users can perform actions like clicking and typing.
2. Some user actions on the frontend will trigger HTTP requests to the backend to store or retrieve data.
3. The frontend sends requests to the backend and handles responses. In Module 3 our responses will mostly consist of HTML, and our frontends will render that HTML.

### Back End

1. Backend typically refers to the server that manages the database.
2. The server listens for incoming requests from the frontend. When it receives a request, it runs logic to determine what response to send back.
3. Until now, our servers only responded with files specified in the URL path. Now we'll add additional logic to our backend to support our apps' needs.

### Bigger Picture

Frontend and backend are relative terms. As our apps get more complex they may involve multiple servers, for example 1 to serve frontend files and another to serve backend logic. Each of these servers can be considered to have "frontend" and "backend" components.

In general, frontend refers to the web, mobile, or desktop client and/or the server that serves the UI to that client, and backend refers to the server\(s\) managing the database.

## What We're Building

This module is about defining the specific mechanics of requests that move from our browser to the back-end, and given some UI design standards, what the user would expect to see as a result of the request.

We are extending the capabilities of the Noodle HTML / CSS file server app, so that we can represent the fundamental data in the noodle app HTML in a different format. \(First JSON, then SQL\).

This gives us the power to build an application in which the JavaScript representation of that data gives us tools to manipulate it an apply logic to it. This data will be dynamic and extensible and the applications' user will be able to see and change it according to the rules and logic of our app.

Remember that building the Tic Tac Toe game relied on a specific implementation of the data- the board- as a 2-dimensional array. Here we are also concerned with making sure that our data is properly formatted so that we can use and manipulate it later.

The fundamental power of a web application is surfacing pure data \(JSON or SQL\) in an HTML format inside the browser.
