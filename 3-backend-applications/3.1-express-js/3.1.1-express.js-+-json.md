# 3.1.1: Express.js + JSON

## Express + JSON Example

We are going to take the basic Express.js example and combine it with the basic JSON file reading example.

### Express.js

```javascript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();

const PORT = 3000;

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');
  response.send('yay');
};

app.get('/', handleIncomingRequest);

app.listen(PORT);
```

### JSON File Reading Example

```javascript
import { read } from './jsonFileStorage.js';

// jsonContent is a JavaScript object. Not a string.
read('data.json', (jsonContent) => {
  console.log(jsonContent);
});
```

### Express.js + JSON

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { read } from './jsonFileStorage.js';

const app = express();

const PORT = 3004;

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');

  // read the JSON file
  read('data.json', (data) => {
    // send back data in the response
    console.log('done with reading');
    response.send(data);
  });
};

app.get('/', handleIncomingRequest);

app.listen(PORT);
```

Here, the nesting, or chronological order of the callbacks is very important. We listen for the request with `handleIncomingRequest`, then wait for the JSON file `read` to also complete **before** we send the response back.

The main difference between this Express file-reading code and our previous `fs` module file-reading code is that Express helps us allocate which callback function should be run based on the request method and URL path, giving us more precise request handling out of the box.

## URL Parameters

Express can get parameterised values for us out of the URL path of the request. This is primarily useful for reusing code that performs similar logic across parameter values, such as "singapore" in the below example. Given paths of `/location/singapore` and `/location/hongkong`, the application logic may return the same kind of location data but for different cities. [github.com](https://github.com) uses URL parameters to determine which user's repos and files to show.

```bash
http://localhost:3004/location/singapore/30045
```

You can separate out and parameterise these values with a route:

```javascript
app.get('/location/:city/:zip', handleIncomingRequest);
```

Anything with a colon before it will be pulled out of the request and put in an object for you.

```javascript
const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in', request.params);
  response.send('yay');
};
```

The console.log should output something like:

```javascript
{
  "city": "singapore",
  "zip": "30045"
}
```

The word after the colon turns into the key. The value in the request turns into the value.

Try it with some other requests:

[http://localhost:3004/location/KL/74665](http://localhost:3004/location/KL/74665)  
[http://localhost:3004/location/sydney/1234](http://localhost:3004/location/sydney/1234)  
[http://localhost:3004/location/banana/apple](http://localhost:3004/location/banana/apple)

## JSON Request

We can use this to take in a parameter for which element we want to get from the JSON file.

### data.json

```javascript
{
  "names": ["Chee Kean", "Susan Chan", "Albert", "Kai"]
}
```

### index.js

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { read } from './jsonFileStorage.js';

const app = express();

const PORT = 3004;

const handleIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');

  // read the JSON file
  read('data.json', (data, error) => {
    // send back data in the response
    console.log('done with reading');

    // we specified this at app.get
    const index = request.params.index;

    // send back the single name we asked for
    response.send(data.names[index]);
  });
};

// get one of the things in the data array
app.get('/names/:index', handleIncomingRequest);

app.listen(PORT);
```

## Query Parameters

Query parameters are another kind of URL-based parameter that Express helps us accept. Query parameters typically take the format of `www.foo.com?myQueryParam=bar`, where query parameters come after the `?` in the URL. Query parameters are commonly used for ephemeral data, e.g. search queries or Google ad click IDs, that do not warrant standalone pages on a website.

Read more about how Express handles query parameters [here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query).

## Exercise

Repeat the above code.

What is the behavior when the request `:index` is not an array index?
