# 3.3.6: SQL Schema Design

## Introduction

SQL schema design is designing SQL table structures and the relationships between them such that data can be stored and retrieved easily and efficiently. When we model real data in Express, each data "model" is usually associated with at least 1 other data model. Using foreign keys we can associate any table to any other table, but how do we decide which information to put in which tables?

There are a few "hard" rules when designing a SQL schema:

1. Never re-use IDs.
2. Never store more than one conceptual "piece" of data in a cell. This means no arrays or JS Objects.
3. Don't duplicate data across multiple tables. For example if `name` exists in 1 table, use a foreign key to reference it instead creating a 2nd `name` column for the same data in a 2nd table.
4. Tables are related to each other through primary key - foreign key columns. Never reference a row in another table as a foreign key with a column other than the primary key.

There will always be well-considered exceptions to these rules, but they are relatively rare. The most common is when dealing with data that is not relational to the rest of the system. Something like a user dice roll may not be relational enough to warrant sticking to the rules above.

## Entity Relationship Diagram \(ERD\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hickey.png)

An ERD \(Entity Relationship Diagram\) is a drawing that lists the relationships and types of relationships between data. The purpose of an ERD is to visually represent how data relates to itself.

There are many different flavours of ERD, used at various stages of planning, analysing and implementing a system. We will mostly be using it as a sketching tool before writing any SQL.

We will **not** be using an ERD to specify any column data types or low-level SQL syntax. Our ERD will be a kind of pseudocode for our `CREATE TABLE` SQL statements.

Our ERD sits one conceptual level above the database. It talks about the kinds of data our app deals with.

## Drawing an ERD

There are online tools that can be used to draw an ERD but pencil and paper work just as well. The following drawing is an example of how to represent one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships in an ERD.

Note that there are a comprehensive set of "official" ERD relationship symbols, but for our purposes, these are not necessary\). See more [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model#Crow's_foot_notation)
