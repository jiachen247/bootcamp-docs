# 3.POCE.2: Express, EJS Noodle App

## Introduction

1. Building on [3.POCE.1: Express Noodle App](3.poce.1-express-noodle-app.md), we will re-create our noodle app from [2.POCE.5: Responsive Noodle Site](../../2-backend-basics/2.poce-post-class-exercises/2.poce.5-responsive-noodle-site.md) with Express and EJS.
2. The main change from 3.POCE.1 is that we will pass response data to `response.render` instead of hard-coding HTML in the request handler. EJS will inject our data into the relevant HTML template and return it to the client.

### Git Branch

Save this current non-HTML version of the app by making a branch to hold this older version. Push this branch to GitHub for later.

To do this current exercise you'll be working on the `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout -b basic-non-html
git push origin basic-non-html
git checkout main
```

You can compare your two branches in a visual GitHub diff using a url like this:

```javascript
github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>/compare/basic-non-html
```

## Base

Copy over the HTML and CSS you wrote in the [last exercise](https://github.com/rocketacademy/noodle-app-css) and use it inside the EJS template.

For now you will have to copy the HTML boilerplate for each EJS file. \(We'll get rid of this inefficiency later\).

Render all the URLs in each recipe object. \(i.e., image URLs as images, other URLs as links\).

### Public

By default, CSS won't work. When your browser creates a request for `styles.css` from the HTML `link` tag, you need Express.js' built-in file server to be enabled.

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

See more[ in the docs here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) and [full docs here.](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static)

Create a directory named `public`. All CSS files will go in this directory.

Make a request for a CSS file inside the directory to make sure that the configs work:

Place your `styles.css` file inside the `public` directory.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/styles.css
```

When you make a request to this URL you should see the contents of the file.

## Comfortable

### Category

On the home page, `/`, make a list of links for all categories. Each link should link to a category page with a list of recipes on it. For example, the following URL should show a page that has a list of recipes.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/category/vegan
```

Each recipe in the list should be a link to its own recipe page, for example at the following URL.

```javascript
http://localhost:3004/recipe/0
```

## More Comfortable

### Order by / Sort by

Create a link for parameter to sort by \(yield, source, caution, category\) **and** a link for sort order, ascending and descending.
