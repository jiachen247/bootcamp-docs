# 3.2.3: Advanced EJS

## Includes

In EJS we can break up repetitive code by splitting it out into other EJS files.

This example below renders an EJS template at line 3. The second argument to `include` is the data that you want this EJS template to have access to. Nothing will be available if you do not pass data in.

See EJS docs on includes [here](https://ejs.co/#docs).

```markup
<ul>
  <% users.forEach(function(user) { %>
    <%- include('user/details', {user: user}); %>
  <% }); %>
</ul>
```

## Headers and Footers

A common pattern is to remove all boilerplate code inside of EJS files to highlight distinct logic in each EJS template. [Boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) refers to code that is repeated in multiple places. 

For example, HTML header and footer code that is shared across all pages can be abstracted away. Headers may include navbars, footers may include website footer content such as links and copyrights.

### recipe.ejs

Header and footer HTML elements are abstracted into `header.ejs` and `footer.ejs` files respectively. In Line 1 below,`header.ejs` gets dynamic data that is generated from the dynamic data received by `recipe.ejs`.

```markup
<%- include('header', {title: `recipe - ${recipe.title}`}); -%>
<h1>Recipe: <%= recipe.title %></h1>
<p>Instructions</p>
<%- include('footer'); -%>
```

### header.ejs

Notice that this file only has the opening `body` tag. The closing `body` tag would be in the `footer.ejs` file.

Also notice that we are passing in the page title \(the text that appears in the tab\) into the function in `recipe.ejs`.

```markup
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
    />

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      integrity="sha384-TX8t27EcRE3e/ihU7zmQxVncDAy5uIKz4rEkgIXeMed4M0jlfIDPvg6uqKI2xXr2"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />

    <title><%= title %></title>
  </head>
  <body>
```

### footer.ejs

```markup
  </body>
</html>
```
