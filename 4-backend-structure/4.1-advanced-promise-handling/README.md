# 4.1: Advanced Promise Handling

## Introduction

In [Module 3.7: JavaScript Promises](../../3-backend-applications/3.7-javascript-promises.md) we learned about Promises and how to use them with `.then` and `.catch`. Now we will learn more advanced promise handling, specifically how to use try/catch blocks with Promises, how to use `.catch` and `Promise.all`, and how to use async/await syntax.
