# 4.1.1: Intro to Sequelize

## Introduction

Sequelize allows us to specify all aspects of our DB schema with JavaScript and provides methods to generate and run SQL queries. This module summarises the setup and core features of Sequelize.

Sequelize is an abstraction on top of SQL and Postgres. When we call a Sequelize method to query the DB, it performs the following steps.

1. Sequelize generates a SQL query using the invoked Sequelize method and relevant parameters
2. Sequelize runs that SQL query through the Pg library, as we have been doing in previous modules
3. Pg executes that SQL query on the connected Postgres DB

## Setup Packages and Folders

### Create App

Create a directory for your app and initialize NPM.

```bash
npm init -y
```

### Install Sequelize NPM Packages

Install `sequelize` and `pg` NPM packages to use Sequelize with Postgres in our app. Sequelize requests that we install `pg` manually because Sequelize also supports other SQL database types such as MySQL and SQLite, and does not install any SQL DB connectors such as `pg` by default to keep the Sequelize library lean.

Install `sequelize-cli` NPM package in development dependencies to generate relevant Sequelize files such as migrations and models from the command line. `sequelize-cli` also allows us to run Sequelize migration files that will update our DB schema in lieu of raw SQL.

```text
npm install pg sequelize
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
```

### Create Sequelize Folders

Create the empty folders `config`, `migrations`, `models`, and `seeders`. These will store Sequelize files that we will need to create for our application. We will explore what each of these folders represents below. We can also create these folders with the [`npx sequelize init`](https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage) command. More on this [here](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html#project-bootstrapping).

```text
mkdir config migrations models seeders
```

## Configure Database

### Create Database Connection Config File

Similar to the `pg` connection config we defined in [Module 3.5.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#pg-npm-library), the Sequelize connection config specifies parameters for Sequelize to connect to our SQL database.

#### Config File Template

```javascript
module.exports = {
  development: {
    username: '<YOUR_UNIX_USER_NAME>',
    password: null,
    // Use "_development" suffix to indicate DB is for development purposes
    database: '<YOUR_DB_NAME>_development',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    dialect: 'postgres',
  },
};
```

#### Sample Config File \(config/config.js\)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  development: {
    // Kai's Unix username is "kai"
    username: 'kai',
    password: null,
    // "grocery" is our example app name, which we also use as our DB name.
    database: 'grocery_development',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    dialect: 'postgres',
  },
};
```

### Create Database Based on Config

Create the database specified in the config using Sequelize CLI's built-in command `db:create`.

```text
npx sequelize db:create
```

## Migrations

Sequelize replaces `init_tables.sql` from Module [3.5.7: Database Setup Files](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.9-database-setup-files.md#init_tables-sql) with a concept called "**migrations**". Database migrations are a system to manage database schema, allowing us to specify changes to database tables and columns over the lifetime of our database.

{% hint style="info" %}
Database migrations only manipulate database schema, but do not determine how our applications interact with the database. Database "**models**" in the following section determine how our apps interact with the DB.
{% endhint %}

Migrations are especially crucial to manage changes to DB schema after our apps go live and contain real-user data. Migrations help us create and run SQL queries to update our schema, while maintaining a record of the update in a "migration file" and in the DB itself. This helps prevent incorrect SQL caused by human error, and helps us keep track of DB state.

Migrations also allow us to quickly re-create copies of our DB by "replaying" all of our migration files in chronological order. This is especially useful for testing and feature development, because it eliminates human error in re-creating DBs with SQL queries.

### Create Migration to Create Items Table

Use `sequelize-cli`'s `migration:generate` command to create a new migration. This specific migration is to create an `Items` table in our database.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the table name `items` is in snake\_case and pluralised, as per SQL naming convention from [Module 3.5.2: PostgreSQL Node App](../../3-backend-applications/3.4-sql-applications/3.4.2-postgresql-node-app.md#sql-entity-naming-and-casing). Column names are also snake\_case. You may notice in the Models section below that corresponding model attributes are in camelCase. This camelCase-snake\_case translation is done by the `underscored` Sequelize option specified in the model file. This allows us to use camel case in JavaScript and snake case in SQL, satisfying casing conventions for both languages.

Sequelize expects table names to be plural, and model names to be singular, and automatically queries for table names that are pluralised forms of our model names in our apps.
{% endhint %}

```text
npx sequelize migration:generate --name create-items-table
```

Replace the contents of the generated file with the following table-creation code. Sequelize is Promise-based, and uses async/await syntax to manipulate async control flow in migration files by default. `queryInterface` is a param provided by Sequelize to manipulate DB schema. See [`queryInterface` docs](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/query-interface.html) for more info.

You may notice that there is an `up` and a `down` section of each migration. The `up` section runs when we execute the migration on the DB. `down` runs when we wish to undo the migration, which should only be done in rare circumstances and almost never in production.

Note that `created_at` and `updated_at` are required columns with Sequelize.

#### Migration File Template

```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('<TABLE_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_PLURAL>', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      },
      <COLUMN_NAME_SNAKE_CASE>: {
        type: Sequelize.<COLUMN_DATA_TYPE_UPPERCASE>,
      },
      // ... [<OTHER_COLUMNS>]
      // created_at and updated_at are required
      created_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      updated_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },

    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('<TABLE_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_PLURAL>');
  },
};
```

#### Sample Migration File \(&lt;GENERATED\_DATE&gt;-create-items-table.js\)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.createTable('items', {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      },
      name: {
        type: Sequelize.STRING,
      },
      // created_at and updated_at are required
      created_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      updated_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
    });
  },

  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.dropTable('items');
  },
};
```

### Run Migration to Create Table

Writing the migration file specifies the DB schema changes. To execute all unexecuted migration files, run `sequelize-cli`'s `db:migrate` command.

```text
npx sequelize db:migrate
```

### Verify Table Creation in Psql

Open Psql with a connection to our DB

```text
psql -d grocery_development
```

Run `\dt` to display tables in the DB

```bash
\dt
```

## Models

Models enable our Node applications to interact with the DB by defining what data is available. Model "**classes**" \(in UpperCamelCase\) have methods that allow us to query the corresponding DB tables, which must be named as the pluralised form of our model names. Model "**instances**" \(in lowerCamelCase\) are instantiations of those classes, and are essentially JavaScript objects with pre-defined attributes, where those attributes are defined in model files and map to the corresponding DB table's columns. Models assume that the DB schema is already set up as per what is defined in the model files. **Models do not manipulate DB schema; only migrations manipulate DB schema.**

### Create Model File for Item Model

In the previous section we wrote and ran a migration to create the `items` table. Now we will define an `Item` model to let our application access the data inside the `items` table.

A model file is essentially a JavaScript class generator that specifies the name of a model and its attributes and associations. Sequelize models correspond directly to DB tables, where the model name should always be the singular form of the table name. For example, the model corresponding to the `items` table must be called "item" in the sequelize definition for Sequelize to work. Sequelize uses model names to generate table names when it translates JavaScript to SQL queries.

#### Model File Template \(models/&lt;MODEL\_NAME\_LOWERCASE\_SINGULAR&gt;.mjs\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note the usage of .mjs file extensions in Modules 4.2.x. This is in lieu of `"type": "module"` in package.json. The .mjs extension lets Node know to treat the file as an ES6 module instead of a CommonJS file.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
export default function init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model(sequelize, DataTypes) {
  return sequelize.define('<MODEL_NAME_SNAKE_CASE_SINGULAR>', {
    id: {
      allowNull: false,
      autoIncrement: true,
      primaryKey: true,
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
    },
    <COLUMN_NAME>: {
      type: Sequelize.<COLUMN_DATA_TYPE_UPPERCASE>,
    },
    // ... [<OTHER_COLUMNS>]
    createdAt: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
    updatedAt: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.DATE,
    },
  }, {
    // The underscored option makes Sequelize reference snake_case names in the DB.
    underscored: true
  });
};
```

#### Sample Model File \(models/item.mjs\)

```javascript
export default function initItemModel(sequelize, DataTypes) {
  return sequelize.define(
    'item',
    {
      id: {
        allowNull: false,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true,
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      },
      name: {
        type: DataTypes.STRING,
      },
      createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: DataTypes.DATE,
      },
    },
    {
      // The underscored option makes Sequelize reference snake_case names in the DB.
      underscored: true,
    }
  );
}
```

### Create Model Index File to Make Models Accessible in App

We will initialise and export all the models we define in a single module. This makes it easy to access models from different modules within our application. In the following code, model classes are exported in a `db` object where keys are model names and values are model classes. The following is a simplified version of the model index file generated by [`npx sequelize init`](https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage).

#### Model Index File Template

```javascript
import sequelizePackage from 'sequelize';
import allConfig from '../config/config.js';

import init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model from './<MODEL_NAME_LOWER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>.mjs';

const { Sequelize } = sequelizePackage;
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = allConfig[env];
const db = {};

let sequelize = new Sequelize(config.database, config.username, config.password, config);

db.<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR> = init<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>Model(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes);

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

export default db;
```

#### Sample Model Index File \(models/index.mjs\)

```javascript
import sequelizePackage from 'sequelize';
import allConfig from '../config/config.js';

import initItemModel from './item.mjs';

const { Sequelize } = sequelizePackage;
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = allConfig[env];
const db = {};

let sequelize = new Sequelize(
  config.database,
  config.username,
  config.password,
  config
);

db.Item = initItemModel(sequelize, Sequelize.DataTypes);

db.sequelize = sequelize;
db.Sequelize = Sequelize;

export default db;
```

## Use Sequelize in App Logic

### Node App to Create Item

Before we use Sequelize with Express, let's create a command-line Node app that creates an `item` entry in the database using Sequelize.

#### Node App File Template

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.<MODEL_NAME_CAPITALIZED_SINGULAR>
  .create({
    <COLUMN_NAME>: <VALUE>,
    [<OTHER_COLUMN_NAMES_AND_VALUES>]
  })
  .then((<RESULT_ROW>) => {
    console.log('success!');
    console.log(<RESULT_ROW>);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

#### Sample Node App File \(create.mjs\)

Sequelize's `create` method generates an `INSERT` query based on the `Item` model we defined above. This inserts a record with the name provided on the command line to the `items` table in our DB.

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.Item.create({
  name: process.argv[2],
})
  .then((item) => {
    console.log('success!');
    console.log(item);
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

Let's run this app to create an Item in the DB.

#### Node Command Template

```text
node create.mjs <ITEM_NAME>
```

#### Sample Node Command

```text
node create.mjs milk
```

Let's verify that this Item now exists in the DB. Open Psql with a connection to our DB

```text
psql -d grocery_development
```

Verify that we inserted our Item in the DB

```text
SELECT * FROM "items";
```

### Node App to Retrieve Items

Let's create another command-line app to retrieve data from our DB using the model-querying functionality of Sequelize.

#### Model Query Node App Template

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.<MODEL_NAME_UPPER_CAMEL_CASE_SINGULAR>.findAll({
  where: {
    <MODEL_COLUMN_NAME>: ['milk']
  }
})
.then((items) => console.log(items[0]))
.catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

#### Sample Model Query Node App \(where.mjs\)

`findAll` method accepts an options object as a parameter that allows us to specify WHERE attributes that we would previously put in our SQL statements.

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

db.Item.findAll({
  where: {
    name: [process.argv[2]],
  },
})
  .then((items) => console.log(items[0]))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

Let's run this app the retrieve Items from the DB

```bash
node where.mjs milk
```
