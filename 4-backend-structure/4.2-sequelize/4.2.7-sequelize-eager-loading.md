# 4.2.7: Sequelize Eager Loading

## Introduction

In Modules [4.2.2](4.2.2-sequelize-one-to-many-relationships.md) and [4.2.4](4.2.4-sequelize-many-to-many.md) we learned how to access associated data via Sequelize getter and setter methods. Typically we would do this sequentially, e.g. retrieve an item, then use a getter method to get all of its categories. Sequelize provides a way called "eager loading" to retrieve this data all at once, which uses join queries under the hood. See more on eager loading syntax [here](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/eager-loading.html).

This section assumes a set of models as described in [4.2.5.](4.2.5-sequelize-many-to-many-with-through-table.md)

### get\_categories.mjs

This is a command-line Node script. Run using the `node` command on command line. User eager loading we can get the first category of the first item in the first cart on line 9 with a single `findAll` query. `include` gives us the ability to retrieve any set of associated models. See `findAll` docs on how to use the `include` parameter [here](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html#static-method-findAll).

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

const getEagerLoadedModels = async () => {
  try {
    const carts = await db.Cart.findAll({
      include: {
        model: db.Item,
        include: [db.Category, db.CartItem],
      },
    });
    console.log(carts[0].items[0].categories[0].name);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getEagerLoadedModels();


```

#### Sample Command

```bash
node get.mjs
```

#### Sample Output

```text
canned
```

### get\_cart\_items.mjs

```javascript
import db from './models/index.mjs';

const getEagerLoadedModels = async () => {
  try {
    const carts = await db.Cart.findAll({
      include: {
        model: db.Item,
        include: [db.Category, db.CartItem],
      },
    });
    
    // get the quantity of items in the cart
    console.log(carts[0].items[0].cart_items[0].quantity);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};

getEagerLoadedModels();
```
