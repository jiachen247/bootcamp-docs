## Getting Started

Begin by forking the exercise repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/drummer-mvc-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/drummer-mvc-bootcamp)

## Base

### Part 1 

Begin by making the migrations and seed data for the app.

Import the `jsSHA` library into the seed file and set every user's password to the same thing: 'password'.

For simplicity, any user in the system can also be a drummer. Use a boolean column called `is_drummer` to set this value in the system. In the seed data make 1/3 of the users that get generated into drummers.

A reservation only has a date. A drummer is hired by day only \(no time\).

### Part 2

When creating the routes begin with a single route and then follow with it's associated MVC components.

Create a route. If needed add a new controller. If needed add a new model. If needed add a new EJS file. \(Don't add all routes or models or controllers at once\).

Create the routes in the order shown above.

### More Comfortable

#### Price

Add a per-gig price for each user/drummer. Create a migration to add this column to the users table. Allow the drummer to set this price in a separate form.

#### Equipment

Add the ability for the drummer to record what equipment they have, such as a drum set or other percussion instruments such as a xylophone. A drummer can have many pieces of equipment.
