| /drummer/:id | GET | Render a single drummer. The id param is a primary key from the users table. |

## Getting Started

Begin by forking the exercise repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/drummer-mvc-bootcamp](https://github.com/rocketacademy/drummer-mvc-bootcamp)

## Base

### Part 1 

Begin by making the migrations and seed data for the app.

Import the `jsSHA` library into the seed file and set every user's password to the same thing: 'password'.

For simplicity, seed the app with all of the drummers. That is, don't allow creation of new drummers in the app.

A reservation only has a date. A drummer is hired by day only \(no time\).

### Part 2

When creating the routes begin with a single route and then follow with it's associated MVC components.

Create a route. If needed add a new controller. If needed add a new model. If needed add a new EJS file. \(Don't add all routes or models or controllers at once\).

Create the routes in the order shown above.

### More Comfortable

#### Price

Add a per-gig price for each user/drummer. Create a migration to add this column to the drummers table.

#### Equipment

Add the ability for the drummer to record what equipment they have, such as a drum set or other percussion instruments such as a xylophone. A drummer can have many pieces of equipment. Since the app does not allow creation of a new drummer, create the seed data for all equipment as well.
