# 2.10: HTTP File Server

We can create a Node.js application that listens for requests for files we have on our computer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/file-server-node.jpg)

#### index.js

```javascript
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { readFile } from 'fs';

const PORT = 3004;

const whenIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request url', request.url);

  var filePath = '.' + request.url;

  readFile(filePath, (error, content) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log('error reading file', error);
      return;
    }

    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    response.end(content, 'utf-8');
  });
};

createServer(whenIncomingRequest).listen(PORT);
```

## Create a text file:

#### hello.txt

```javascript
Hello My Text File.
```

## Run the server:

When this runs, the server does not run through the code and then end. It's waiting for incoming requests until you press `Ctrl+C`. Look for this running process in the Activity Monitor / Task Manager.

```javascript
node index.js
```

## Make a request to the server from the browser:

[http://localhost:3004/hello.txt](http://localhost:3004/hello.txt)

We are using the path portion of the URL to tell the `readFile` `fs` function where to look on the computer.

We'll continue to use this equivalence of the file path and the URL path to specify "resources" later.

## Exercise

Clone [the base node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Repeat the above code.

Request for a file that does not exist.

Create an HTML file in the directory and make a request for it.

Look at the request for the server in the Chrome dev tools networking tab.

Copy all of the files for your video poker project into the directory and request for the HTML file from your browser.
