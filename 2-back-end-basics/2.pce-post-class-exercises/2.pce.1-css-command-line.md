# 2.PCE.1: CSS Command Line

Begin with this starter code repo: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/css-conversions-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/css-conversions-swe1)

Remember to work on a forked copy and submit a Pull Request once done.

## Base

Create a command line tool that will convert a hex code CSS color into a hex code CSS color.

In order to do the mathematical conversion you can simply [copy and paste this Stack Overflow answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623838/rgb-to-hex-and-hex-to-rgb) \(The point of this exercise is not the conversion\).

Running this command:

```text
node index.js '#ffffff'
```

Results in this output:

```text
rgb(255,255,255)
```

## Comfortable

Give an option to convert from rgb to hex:

```text
node index.js rgbhex rgb(255,255,255)
```

Results in:

```text
#ffffff
```

## More Comfortable

Convert the color to HSL.

Convert any color to the other two. \(RGB -&gt; hex, hex -&gt; RGB, HSL -&gt; RGB, etc.\)

Auto-detect what the input format is and show the other two.
