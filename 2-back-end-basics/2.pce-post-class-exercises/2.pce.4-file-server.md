# 2.PCE.4: File Server

## Base

Create a complete file server Node.js application.

This file server application has the following HTTP protocol attributes:

It listens for GET requests and sends back files.

It listens on the port that was specified in the command. This command sets the port to 3004:

```text
node index.js 3004
```

It responds with status code 200 when it finds and sends back a file.

It responds with "Sorry we couldn't file your page my friend!" and status code 404 when it doesn't file a file.

## Comfortable

Reference [this example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework) for file type headers in the response.

It only sends a file back when it can detect the file type of the requested file.

It sets the correct content type in the header of the response.

It sends back an HTML 404 page when it can't find something.

Create an easter egg so that whenever a user visits /banana they get back the response "hello banana!".

On every response create an easter egg header of 'awesome-rocket-academy' in the response. Set the value to 'banana'.
