# 2.PCE.6: Todo List - JSON

## Base

Begin with the [terminal-todo repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/terminal-todo-swe1)

Create a command line todo list that stores the list in JSON.

The `data.json` file will begin like this:

```javascript
{
  "items": []
}
```

Use the app with the following commands:

### Show

Show all the items in the list:

```text
node index.js show
```

Will output a list like this:

```text
- wash the car
- cook dinner
- buy bananas
```

### Add

Add an item to the list.

```text
node index.js add "send flowers"
```

## Comfortable

### Complete

Add numbers to the display of the list of items. These numbers would be related to the index of the array.

Add the ability to **complete** items. Keep a separate list for done items.

```text
Todo:
1. wash the car
2. cook dinner
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

```text
node index.js done 2
```

```text
Todo:
1. wash the car
2. buy bananas

Done:
1. cook dinner
```

## More Comfortable

### More \`jsonFileStorage\` Methods

What other methods can be added to the `jsonFileStorage` module that would useful and also be useful for other apps?

Some suggestions:

```javascript
// remove an element from the array
// pass the key and the element index you want to delete from the array
delete('data.json', "people", 2, (dataWithoutItem) => {
  // ...
});

// edit / replace a value
// pass the key, element index, and the value you want to replace it *with*
editOneElement('data.json', "people", 2, {name: "andrew"}, (dataWithChangedItem) => {
  // ...
});
```

### Dates

Add dates for when the item was added and completed. Use the [JavaScript Date object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

### Edit

Change the text of a given item.

```text
Todo:
1. wash the car
2. cook dinner
3. buy bananas

Done:
```

```text
node index.js change 2 "cook supper"
```

Changes the list to look like this:

```text
Todo:
1. wash the car
2. cook supper
3. buy bananas

Done:
```
