# 2.8: Chrome Networking

## Introduction

We've already been using our browsers' networking functionality behind the scenes. We're now ready to talk about HTML files and what happens in our browser when we visit websites on the internet such as google.com.

**In essence, every time we enter a URL into our browser's address bar we send a request to retrieve an HTML file.** This mechanic is the foundation of internet networking. Browser request behaviour is a cornerstone of all web-based software.

## Network Tab

The Dev Tools networking tab is the part of the Dev Tools that can be used to analyze network requests.

1. Click on one of the items in the list of requests to see the detail view for that request.
2. Click on the response tab to see the raw response text.

## Browser Network Activity Types

### Typing in Address Bar

When you type a host name into the address bar:

1. A DNS request resolves your domain to an IP address.
2. Chrome browser makes an HTTP GET request on port 80.

### HTML Tag Request Behaviour

#### A script / link tag

```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" >
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" ></script>
```

When the browser sees this tag, it downloads a file to be parsed by other parts of the browser.

#### An img tag

```markup
<img src="http://www.images.com/example.jpg"/>
```

When the browser sees this tag it downloads a file to be displayed within the page.

#### A link tag

```markup
<a href="http://www.google.com">google</a>
```

When the user clicks a link, the browser makes an HTTP method GET request to the address specified in the href attribute. Most of the time the response to this request is an HTML file that the browser will display on the screen.

#### A form tag

```markup
<form method="POST" action="http://google.com">
  <input type="text" name="name"/>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
```

When the user submits a form it creates a request, according to properties of the form. In this case an HTTP method POST request. \(We will dig more into this type of request later\).

## Exercise

1. Open the Chrome DevTools networking tab.
2. Write each of the above tags in an HTML file and look in the network tab to see the request that gets created.
3. When the a tag link gets clicked, watch for the HTML code in the response to the request.
4. For the form tag, go to google.com homepage. Inspect the page to find the form for the search bar.
   1. Inspect the form and input elements.
   2. Inspect the request that the browser sends when the form submits.
