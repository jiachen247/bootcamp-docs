# 2.2: Command Line Programs

We will create basic command line programs using Node.js' built-in [`process`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process) global variable.

## `process.argv`

`process.argv` contains all the information about what was typed into the terminal when the Node.js program was executed.

Create this `index.js` file:

```javascript
console.log('this is process argv!');
console.log(process.argv);
```

Run it a few times in the terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

```javascript
node index.js tomatoes
```

```javascript
node index.js apples bananas
```

```javascript
node index.js chicken pork beef
```

Notice the data type of `process.argv` and how the contents of the array changes depending on what you wrote in the command.

Notice that `process.argv[0]` is the absolute path to the appication on your computer, Node.js.

Notice that `process.argv[1]` is the absolute path to the JavaScript file the computer is running.

### Data Types

Note the the data type of the `process.argv` is always a string.

#### index.js

```javascript
console.log('Process argv values are strings!');
console.log(process.argv[2] + process.argv[3] + process.argv[4]);
```

```bash
node index.js 1 1 1 # this will output 111, not 3
```

## Metric Conversion Program

Use `process.argv` to capture input from the user. Since the first two elements of the `process.argv` array will be the Node.js path and the file path, we start looking for user arguments at element 2.

#### Convert kilometers into miles

```javascript
const distanceInKilometers = process.argv[2];

const distanceInMiles = Number(distanceInKilometers) * 0.62;

console.log(distanceInMiles);
```

```javascript
node index.js 76
```

#### Convert liters to gallons

```javascript
node index.js 1 // this should output 0.264172
```
