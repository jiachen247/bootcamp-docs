# 2.ICE.4: Internet 2

## Internet

Interact with the internet with your partner.

### Make Requests

Copy the [file server](../2.9-file-server.md) into an `index.js`.

Copy one of the [HTML & CSS exercise](../../1-front-end-basics/1.1-html-and-css/) files into the folder so that you can serve it.

Open a new terminal and start your server:

```text
node index.js
```

**Open a new terminal window** and start it. Leave the other terminal window open.

```text
./ngrok http 3004
```

Send your partner message with the full ngrok URL for the HTML file. It should look something like this: [http://da7878cb162d.ngrok.io/index.html](http://da7878cb162d.ngrok.io)

Make a request to your partner's ngrok address.
