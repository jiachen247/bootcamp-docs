# 2.ICE.5: JSON Cards

We will create a game of cards where the current state of the card game is always stored in a local file.

## Base

Begin with [the base starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Copy [the deck array from SWE101](https://swe101.rocketacademy.co/10-javascript-objects/10.1-objects#deck) into your `index.js`.

We'll use the [`jsonFileStorage` module from 2.13.1](../2.13-json/2.13.1-json-module-read-write.md).

### Shuffle V1

```text
node index.js shuffle
```

Shuffle the deck and then use the `add` function of the module to record it permanently in the JSON file.

### Deal V1

```text
node index.js deal
```

Read from the deck by calling the `read` function.

### Why we can't just use \`jsonFileStorage\` as-is

The `read` function can't truly deal two cards, because it can only `console.log`. We can't leave the module intact and `read` or `pop` 2 cards from the deck, or even format the output in any way, e.g. "Queen of Spades".

We'll use `read` and `write` together and write our own card logic.

Begin the game by using [this data.json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rocketacademy/swe1-docs/master/2-back-end-basics/2.13.1-json/data.json) of an unshuffled deck, and one key for the hand.

Whenever we need to change something in `data.json`, create a new function for it based on the `modifyJsonFile` function below. Write the needed logic to change the JSON data starting on line 11.

```javascript
const modifyJsonFile = (filename) => {
  // set the file read callback
  const whenFileIsRead = (error, jsonContent) => {
    // check for reading errors
    if (error) {
      console.log('reading error', error);
    }

    // make JSON string into an object
    const content = JSON.parse(jsonContent);
    console.log(content);

    // here is where any changes to the JSON file go

    // change the object into a string
    const stringContent = JSON.stringify(content);

    // set the file read callback
    const whenFileIsWritten = (error) => {
      // check for reading errors
      if (error) {
        console.log('writing error', error);
      }
    };

    // read the file
    writeFile(filename, stringContent, whenFileIsWritten);
  };

  // read the file
  readFile(filename, 'utf-8', whenFileIsRead);
};
```

### Shuffle V2

Shuffle the cards:

```text
node index.js shuffle
```

This command should get the current value of the card deck and write out the shuffled version.

Open the `data.json` file to confirm that the cards in the deck have been shuffled.

### Deal V2

```text
node index.js deal
```

Take 2 cards _out of the deck_ and put them in the `currentHand` key of `data.json`.

Print out the cards.

Open the `data.json` file to confirm that the top two cards have been taken out of the deck and put into the hand.

### High Card

```text
node index.js play
```

Deal 2 cards out of the deck, 1 for the computer player and 1 for the human player. The winner has the highest card.

```text
Computer got: 2 of spades.
You have: 9 of hearts.
You win!
```

## Comfortable

Incorporate Blackjack logic into the game. Evaluate the cards based on the rules of Blackjack. \(Without the logic of adding cards to the hand\). You can reuse logic from previous code.

## More Comfortable

Implement the rest of a Blackjack game \(in this order\):

* Allow the player to hit
* Implement the dealer behaviour. This shouldn't need a separate key in `data.json`.
* Implement splits
