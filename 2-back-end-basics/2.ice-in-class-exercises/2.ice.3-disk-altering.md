# 2.ICE.3: Disk Altering

## JavaScript Processor

Read in a JavaScript file. Change all the comments from `//` style to `/* */`. Keep them on the same line.

#### script.js

```javascript
// a function that adds two numbers together
const add = (a,b) => {
    return a + b;
};
```

```text
node index.js script.js
```

script.js file should look like this:

```javascript
/* a function that adds two numbers together */
const add = (a,b) => {
    return a + b;
};
```

## Comfortable

### HTML Processor

```text
node html.js mystuff.html
```

Create a node program to create an HTML file based on the [Bootstrap getting started template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template). The body will have one `h1` inside that says "hello".

### Lorem Picsum

[Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) is a service that allows you to use nice place holder photos in your HTML.

Accept a number argument that will set the number of `img` tags in the body.

```text
node html.js some-html.html 4
```

### Columns

Add the ability to specify bootstrap columns in the page.

```text
node html.js new-html.html 4 3
```

## More Comfortable

### Photo Gallery

```text
node html.js some-html.html /path/to/photos
```

Accept a path argument to a folder that contains a set of photos.

Use `fs` to copy the files into the HTML file's folder, and build an img tag for each image file with the correct relative path.
