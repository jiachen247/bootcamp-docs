# 2.ICE.6: npm / jsonFileStorage

### npm

Begin by cloning the [base node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Install the[ talk-like-a npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/talk-like-a) and set it to talk like a Swedish chef.

The user can run the program on the command line with any text and the app will output the result:

```text
node index.js 'Hello! How are you today?'
```

Output:

```text
Hellu! Hoo ere-a yuoo tudey? Bork Bork Bork!
```

### jsonFileStorage

#### Roll

When the user types this command

```text
node index.js roll
```

```text
You rolled 6.
```

Roll a dice and record the roll in a `data.json`.

```json
{
  "rolls": [6]
}
```

#### Average

Get the average roll.

Given this data:

```json
{
  "rolls": [3, 3, 3]
}
```

```text
node index.js average
```

Results in this output:

```text
Average is 3.
```

### Most Rolled

Also keep an object in data.json that counts how many times each dice side was rolled:

```json
{
  "rolls": [3, 3, 3, ...],
  "sidesRolled": {
    "1": 4,
    "2": 0,
    "3": 6,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1,
    "6": 3
  }
}
```

Every time the dice is rolled, output the most rolled dice.

```text
node index.js roll
```

```text
You rolled 6.
3 has been rolled the most times.
```
