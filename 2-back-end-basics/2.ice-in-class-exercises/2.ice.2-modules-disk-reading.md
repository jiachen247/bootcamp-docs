# 2.ICE.2: Modules, Disk Reading

## CSS Conversion Module

Extract the [CSS command line conversions](../2.pce-post-class-exercises/2.pce.1-css-command-line.md) into a module file called `cssConvert.js`. The module should export all the conversion functions.

## Javascript Comment Counter

Read in a JavaScript file as per examples in [Module 2.4](../2.4-disk-reading.md#basic-example). Output the number of lines that have comments in them.

**myJsFile.js**

```javascript
// a function that adds two numbers together
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

```text
node index.js myJsFile.js
```

Outputs:

```text
Line 1: "a function that adds two numbers together"
```

Move the comment code into its own module.

## Comfortable

List all the functions in the code and their parameters. This should work for functions in general and not just the specific function in the example below.

```javascript
// a function that adds two numbers together
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

```text
node index.js myJsFile.js
```

Outputs:

```text
add: parameters: a, b
```

Add the code to the above module.

Add an option to list the functions by line number or alphabetically by their name.

## More Comfortable

Allow your program to take an absolute path and find all files in that directory named script.js and do the analysis on those files.

```text
node '/Users/kai/code' script.js
```
