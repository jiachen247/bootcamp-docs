# 2.0: Module 2 Overview

## **Backend Fundamentals**

The focus of the entire SWE1 course is building applications that interact with the internet.

Before we can begin to create those applications we need to gain an understanding of the basis for the environment in which these applications operate and a few of the underlying mechanisms going on when we talk about the internet.

## Install Node.js
