# 2.0: Module 2 Overview

## **Backend Fundamentals**

The focus of SWE1 is building applications that interact with the internet.

Before we can create those applications we need to understand the environment in which the applications operate and a few underlying mechanisms of the internet.

## Install Node.js

### Mac

```text
brew install node@14
```

### Windows

You should already have node installed.

Check by typing the following in the terminal, which will check the node version.

```text
node -v
```

## New Online Accounts

### AWS

Sign up for an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com) if you don't have one already. We will use this to set up servers in the cloud to which we will deploy our code.

### Namecheap

Sign up for a [Namecheap account](https://namecheap.com) to buy a domain name.
