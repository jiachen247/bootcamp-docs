# 2.14: npm

npm is a command line command that helps manage your Node.js project.

Create a folder with an npm project inside it.

```text
mkdir my-first-node-project
cd my-first-node-project
npm init -y
```

## package.json

Open the `package.json` file in VSCode.

```javascript
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Some Random Stuff.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/rocketacademy/my-repo.git"
  },
  "author": "me",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

package.json is the file that has all the configuration info about your project. Just like you have a single git repo for a project, you also have a single package.json file for a project.

## Downloading Library Code

NPM allows us to download code library modules from the internet.

```text
npm install cows
```

These are called packages. Every package can be accessed in several different forms.

Let's take the one in the example above:

* You can download it from the command line by mentioning it's official name. \(In this case `cows`\).
* You can visit the official [npm website page for that package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cows)
* Almost every npm package has a [github.com repo.](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cows)

## Require

Before Node.js version 12 there was a different default syntax for getting a hold of code in different files. \(For our current purposes the two are exactly the same. There are a few differences when we get to React\).

Many packages still demonstrate this older way of requiring a package into a file:

```text
const cows = require('cows');
```

The equivalent statement in import syntax would be:

```text
import cows from 'cows';
```

For RA's default Node.js setup we will only use `import`. In order to use `import` with Node.js this key/value must be added to the `package.json`: `"type":"module"`.

## Dependencies

The developer ecosystem around npm \(and all package systems\) means that one package can depend on another package, and so on. In a modern node package this dependency graph grows quite large.

This is the dependency graph for react:
