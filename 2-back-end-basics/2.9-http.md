# 2.9: HTTP

HTTP stands for [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP#:~:text=Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol%20%28HTTP%29%20is,be%20used%20for%20other%20purposes.), a protocol that determines how data is sent across the internet through HTTP Requests and Responses.

## What is a Server

[Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29) a server is: "_a piece of computer software that provides functionality for other programs called "clients"_."

Within this course we'll define a server as a program that listens for requests over the network. This idea that the server is the thing waiting for requests is the main mechanic / modality we'll be building upon in the rest of the course.

## Server That Responds With 'yay'

#### index.js

```javascript
import { createServer } from 'http';

const PORT = 3004;

const whenIncomingRequest = (request, response) => {
  console.log('request came in');

  response.end('yay', 'utf-8');
};

createServer(whenIncomingRequest).listen(PORT);
```

After you run this file:

```javascript
node index.js
```

This server is available at: [http://localhost:3004](http://localhost:3004)

Note that when this runs, the server does not run through the code and then end. It's waiting for incoming requests until you press `Ctrl+C`.

Look for this running process in the Activity Monitor / Task Manager.

## Node.js Asynchronous Network Actions

All of the interfacing we'll be doing with the computer in Node.js we will be doing in an asynchronous way.

The fundamental reason for this is because of the relative "distance" or speed of a given part of the computer.

## Node.js Server Callbacks

The analogous action from the point of view of our program is that our `whenIncomingRequest` callback has the same conceptual functionality as an `addEventListener` callback function. -It is the action that is run when the "user" makes an action. From our current perspective the "user" is the computer making the request.

## Internet Latency

When you interact with the internet:

1. It's slow.
2. You don't know how long it will take.

Getting something from the internet could take a literal million times \(10‚Å∂\) times longer than getting something from the hard drive. Because most internet software expects to be accessed in many different contexts and from many different devices, you also have no control over the consistency of the speed. It will sometimes be fast, and sometimes be slow, and your application has to account for all of these situations.

## Network Request to Yourself

### 127.0.0.1

There is a special IP address that doesn't access the network outside of the computer. It simply sends the request back around to the computer as if a request had come in from outside.

### localhost

localhost is the hostname that is resolved directly on your computer to 127.0.0.1

![](../.gitbook/assets/my-document-8-2.jpg)

\(Note that localhost isn't specific to HTTP\).

## Headers

Headers are meta information about a given request. There are many different kinds of standard header values, we'll be looking them as we need them.

We make a logical distinction between the request being made and meta information about the request.

## HTTP Request Headers

### HTTP Method Header

The method indicates what kind of action the user is requesting the server do. The method is one of nine words that describes what kind of request is being made. The request method _is part of the JavaScript server application input_. It is up to you as the application programmer to decide which method most accurately describes the kind of request you are sending and accepting.

GET is the default method when you type into the browser bar. This method specification is sent in the header of the request.

GET means that you are _requesting to get something_. \(This language may seem redundant, but we'll see for the other methods, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., that you can, for example, request to delete something\).

## HTTP Response Headers

### Status Code

The status code is the number that indicates what the server application says about the response. A status code _is part of the JavaScript application output_. It is up to you as the application programmer to decide which status code most accurately describes a given situation.

200 is the status code number that means everything was OK.

Use the method `writeHead` to set the status code of the response.

```javascript
response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
```

Look up[ in the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_writehead_statuscode_statusmessage_headers) for more on writeHead.

## Send Requests Out

The main modality of making requests that we'll be using is the Chrome browser. But it's very important to understand that HTTP requests are not specifically related to the browser. An HTTP request can be made from many different kinds of applications, for many different reasons.

### Send Requests with Chrome

Type in google.com to the address bar.

### Send HTTP Requests with the Command Line

`curl` is a command line program that can make requests.

```text
curl google.com
```

See some more [curl examples here.](https://cheatsheet.dennyzhang.com/cheatsheet-curl-a4)

### Send Requests with Node.js

```javascript
import { get } from 'http';

const whenResponseReceived = (resp) => {
  let data = '';

  // A chunk of data has been received.
  resp.on('data', (chunk) => {
    data += chunk;
  });

  // The whole response has been received. Print out the result.
  resp.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Response Data ===>', data);
  });
};

get('http://info.cern.ch/', whenResponseReceived).on('error', (err) => {
  console.log('Error: ' + err.message);
});
```

## Exercise

Clone [the base node repo.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-node-swe1)

Set up your server that listens for requests to come in.

Make a request to your server with each of the methods above.

Make a request to google with each of the methods above.

Make a request to: [http://info.cern.ch/](http://info.cern.ch/) with each of the methods above.

Use the Chrome networking tools and click into the request detail. Look for the header details of the HTTP method and status code.

Set your own header of: `rocket-academy-wow` and set the value to `true`.

Set other status codes in the header such as [206](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206), [418](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418) and [507](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/507). What do they do?

Set the special status code 300 like so:

```javascript
response.writeHead(301, { Location: 'http://info.cern.ch/' });
```

What does it do? What does the network tab look like?
