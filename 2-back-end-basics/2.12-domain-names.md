# 2.12: Domain Names

![Namecheap is one \(but not the only\) resource that holds the domain-to-IP address mapping.](../.gitbook/assets/dns.jpg)



You can buy a domain name on [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) and associate it with your AWS instance. Namecheap is a popular a domain name marketplace. Other popular marketplaces include GoDaddy and Google Domains, among many others.

Note that if you ever stop your AWS instance your domain name will stop working. This is because a _**new**_ IP address is assigned when an instance is started up. If you want to keep your domain name tied to AWS even if you stop your instance you need to use an [AWS Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html).

## Buy a Domain

Create an account on namecheap.com. Buy a domain name.

## Configure DNS

Go to the domain management console.

Set the host to `@` and the IP to your EC2 instance IP.

You should now be able to visit your server address with the same place, but with the domain in place of the IP, something like [http://banana.loan/index.html](http://banana.loan/index.html)

It's possible there will be a small delay as the DNS servers update with your new domain-IP mapping. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you purchase a domain name with Namecheap, they set their DNS servers with your new record. Afterwards, the DNS system updates records on other \(non-namecheap\) DNS servers. This is how DNS works- records that exist on one server get propagated to other servers in the system. Sometimes there is a delay while this information gets spread.
