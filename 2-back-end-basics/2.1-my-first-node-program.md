# 2.1: My First Node.js Program

![In green, the hardware parts of the computer that are abstracted by the operating system: The monitor, the hard drive and the network hardware.](../.gitbook/assets/my-document-8-%20%281%29.jpg)

We already saw the browser interact with 3 specific important parts of the computer:

1. The screen of the computer.
2. Getting files from the computer hard disk.
3. Getting data from the internet - the networking hardware of the computer.
4. \(other things are getting signals from the keyboard and mouse hardware of the computer, playing sounds on the speaker / audio hardware\)

## What is Node.js

We are going to shift gears to run JavaScript in a new environment.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs directly on your computer and can interact directly with your computer.

The JavaScript engine that we used on the Chrome browser was extracted out to be run independent of the browser environment. \(This [engine is called V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_%28JavaScript_engine%29)\).

For the purposes of this course there are two important parts of the computer we want our Node.js programs to interact with. 1. The hard drive of the computer. 2. The networking hardware \(that is connected to the internet\).

Before we integrate these other aspects of the computer, first we are going to prove that we can run a whole complete JavaScript program directly on our computer.

## Where are we going

We will be using the Node.js environment to create a_pplication servers_ that listens for incoming network requests from the internet, and save data onto a computer hard drive, and give back responses- sometimes as HTML pages.

We are going to learn how a given set of HTML gets to the browser and how we can control which HTML gets to the browser though the way we request things.

We'll see that a request can save things onto the hard drive.

## Javascript Development Console Environment

```bash
node
```

This takes you into an environment like the Dev Tools Console. Except that there are no files loaded or related to the environment.

Try typing some Javascript operations like:

```text
2 + 2
7 * 6
'hello' + 'world'
```

Type `ctrl ^ c` to exit out.

## My First Node Program

Create a directory and put a single file inside.

```bash
cd a-swe1
mkdir my-first-node
cd my-first-node
touch index.js
```

Inside of `index.js`:

```text
console.log('hello');
```

Run the program:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Command Line Programs

The environment of the command line is just a way to interface with the operating system, and to run programs.

Just like the `git` command is an application we downloaded and installed on our computers, `node index.js` is a program that we created and will run on our computers just like anything else.

## Process

### What is a process?

A process is an operating system representation of a single program. Each Chrome window is a process on your computer. Typically every single application or application part will have it's own process.

When we run our Node.js programs they will also have their own process.

We can prove that this is true by typing `node` into the command line again. We will be able to see this program running on the computer.

Open the Task Manager \(Windows\) or Activity Monitor \(Mac\).

Look for or search for `node` and highlight the process. Type `ctrl ^ c` in the command line. The process in the Task Manager / Activity Monitor wil disappear.

### See your own Nodejs program in the Activity Monitor

Normally your JavaScript runs so fast that the won't see the process begin and end in the Activity Monitor.

We can fix this by having the program run an artifically long time.

```text
var counter = 0;
while(true){
  counter = counter + 1;
}
```

Now when we run this program from the command line it will continue to run forever untile we kill it.

```text
node index.js
```

Look for this process in your Activity Monitor. It should be taking up 100% of one core.

Type ctrl ^c to exit.

### Process Variable

In the DOM - the other context of running JavaScript we saw before, the variables that _**represented**_ our running environment \(a browser window/tab\) were the two variables `window` and `document`.

To refresh on this concept, open any page in your Chrome browser and open the Dev Tools. Type `document` and `window` in the console.

For `window` click the triangle to see the keys inside this object. What are two keys that represent the state of the window or some data about the current page?

In Nodejs we also have one variable that represents the environment our code is running in: `process`.

Create a new node program with one line:

```text
console.log( process );
```

Run it:

```text
node index.js
```

Find some relevant keys in the `process` object.
