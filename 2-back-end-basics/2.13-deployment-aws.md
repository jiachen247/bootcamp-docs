# 2.11: Deployment: AWS

AWS EC2 allows you to run code on a different computer.

AWS is on the "cloud", which simply means you can request AWS to create you a virtualized computer "instance" \(AWS' terminology\).

We'll use this instance as a place to run our Node.js code and act as a server.

This instance will have an IP address that is public on the real internet.

## Create an AWS EC2 Instance

Log into AWS. This link assures that you are in the Singapore AWS region. [https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](%20https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2)

Click the Launch Instance button.

Click to choose the Ubuntu version 20.04 AMI.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.42.45-pm.png)

Make sure to select the free "micro" EC2 instance type.

Skip ahead by clicking to the Configure Security Group tab.

We want to change it to allow general public HTTP port 80 requests. Click the Add Rule button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.43.06-pm.png)

Select HTTP from the dropdown.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.43.18-pm.png)

The default configuration will give you HTTP on port 80.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.43.23-pm.png)

Click to Review and click the blue Launch button at the bottom.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.43.32-pm.png)

AWS will bring up a modal and ask you about how you plan to access the instance.

Choose to create a new key, name it, and click the Download button.

After you've downloaded the key, click the Launch Instance button. There's no way to access the instance if you didn't download the key first.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.44.04-pm.png)

You will be taken to the Instance Launching page. Click the link to your new instance.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.44.08-pm.png)

Once you're on the instance list view click into your new instance.

![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-30-at-8.44.20-pm.png)

The instance detail page will show you the public IP of your instance.

Note that the "open address" link defaults to https, which won't work with our http-only server code.

## SSH - Log In

Change the permissions of the key file to 400.

```text
chmod 400 path/to/filename
```

SSH into the instance.

```text
ssh -i /path/to/keyfile ubuntu@ec2-public-IP
```

## Just Another Computer

You are now using the terminal, but on a computer that belongs to AWS.

You are connected via [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet), which means that whatever you type on your own computer gets sent directly to the AWS computer \(specifically keystroke by keystroke\).

Use some command line commands to look around this computer. \(This computer has no Graphical User Interface\).

```
ls -la
```

Find a file or directory that you also have on your own computer. Use `cd` if you need to. 

To prove this is just like your computer, create a file:

```text
touch mytext.txt
```

Type any other command line commands you want. Are there any you can or can't run?

Note: SSH \(`ssh` command\) is an encrypted telnet connection.

## Install Node.js

```text
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
```

```text
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

On the Ubuntu operating system \(and all other [Debian derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based) systems\) apt is the family of commands that manages installing things on the system.

See more about [apt](https://itsfoss.com/apt-get-linux-guide/) here.

## Run a Server

Get the example server:

```text
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/file-server-example-swe1
```

```text
cd file-server-example-swe1
```

```text
sudo node index.js 80
```

Test it by requesting the server at your IP address. It should look something like: [http://54.255.234.39/index.html](http://54.255.234.39/index.html)

## Logout 

Type `exit`.

```text
exit
```

## Permanently Running Server

When we logout the server will stop running.

To keep the server running:

```text
nohup sudo node index.js &
```

[https://linux.101hacks.com/unix/nohup-command/](https://linux.101hacks.com/unix/nohup-command/)

## Quit the permanently running Server

Each running process on a computer has an ID.

To quit the server we have to find the ID number \(PID, which stands for Process ID\) and use it to kill that process in the instance.

Get a list of all processes: 

```text
ps -ax
```

Filter the list of processes by using the unix pipe `|` to send it to the `grep` command.

```text
ps -ax | grep node
```

Take note of the PID and use it to run `kill`. 

```text
kill -9 <my PID of the node server>
```

Check that your server is not running by attempting a request.
