# 5.ICE.4: Cross-Domain AJAX

## Introduction

With AJAX we can also make requests to servers owned by others.

### CORS

CORS stands for Cross Origin Request Sharing. It means the ability to communicate with a server not from our own domain \(localhost in this case\). Chrome locks down JavaScript communication to outside services by default because it is considered a security risk. [This public list](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists) shares services that support CORS requests. [Read more on CORS here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#see_also).

### API Documentation

For this ICE we will query a weather API by Metaweather. [Here is the documentation](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) for requests we can make.

Due to CORS limitations we will send requests to this domain \([https://metaweather-with-cors.now.sh](https://metaweather-with-cors.now.sh/api/location/search/?query=san)\) instead of www.metaweather.com. 

## Base

### Setup

Begin with the [DOM starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-next-steps-dom) No backend needed for this exercise.

### SG Weather

When the page loads, use JavaScript to create a button on screen. When the user clicks the button, make a request for the current weather in Singapore. Display the result data on the page using DOM manipulation.

Add the icons listed in the documentation onto the page. Past students have found that to retrieve icons, we can send requests to https://www.metaweather.com directly.

## Comfortable

### Weather on Specific Dates

Add another set of inputs where the user can input a date, and get the weather for that date in Singapore.

## More Comfortable

### Weather Based on User Location

Use the [browser location data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the current location of the user. Use this to display the weather for them.
