# 5.ICE.4: Cross Domain AJAX

With AJAX you can also make a request to servers other than your own.

### CORS

CORS stands for Cross Origin Request Sharing- it means the ability to communicate with a server not from your own domain \(localhost in this case\). Chrome locks down JavaScript communication to outside services by default because it is considered a security risk. The list of services above lists whether or not CORS requests are supported.

More on CORS [here. ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#See_also)

### API Documentation

The list of requests you can make is here: [https://www.metaweather.com/api/](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

Because of CORS you must make the requests to this domain: [https://metaweather-with-cors.now.sh](https://metaweather-with-cors.now.sh/api/location/search/?query=san) instead of www.metaweather.com.

This API was taken from a list here: [https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists)

## Base

Begin with the [DOM starter code.](https://github.com/rocketacademy/basics-next-steps-dom) \(No backend needed for this exercise\).

#### SG Weather

When the page loads, use JavaScript to create a button on screen. When the user clicks the button, make a request for the current weather in Singapore. Display the result data on the page using DOM manipulation.

Add the icons listed in the documentation onto the page.

## Comfortable

#### Dates

Add another set of inputs where the user can input a date, and get the weather for that date in Singapore.

## More Comfortable

Use the [browser location data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the current location of the user. Use this to display the weather for them.
