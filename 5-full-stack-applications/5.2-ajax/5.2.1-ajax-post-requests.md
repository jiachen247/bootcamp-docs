# 5.2.1: AJAX POST Requests

## Introduction

We will use POST requests with AJAX to create new `Item` entries in the DB. We will update our frontend logic to send POST requests \(first with hard-coded data, then with user input\), and update our backends to accept and handle those POST requests.

## Exercise

### Setup Server and Items Route

1. Clone the [`ajax-bootcamp` repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-bootcamp)
2. Install NPM packages
3. Run migrations and seeds with Sequelize. There is a migration and seed file in the repo.
4. Start server locally
5. Visit `http://localhost:3004/items` in the browser to verify the server is set up and the browser can receive items in the response.

### Create New Page that Sends AJAX POST Request

1. Add a new route for a page
2. Add a view for this page
3. Add a `script` tag to the view page for a JavaScript file called `script.js`
4. Add a JavaScript file called `script.js` to the `public` folder
5. Add a `script` tag to the view page to import Axios

   ```markup
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
   ```

6. Add this Axios example to `script.js`

   ```javascript
   const data = {
     name: 'orange',
     description: 'zesty',
   };

   // Make a request to create an item
   axios
     .post('/items', data)
     .then((response) => {
       // handle success
       console.log(response);
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // handle error
       console.log(error);
     });
   ```

7. Read [more about Axios here.](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/README.md#example)

### Express Body Parser Configuration

We will bind another body parser middleware `express.json()` to Express to read data from our AJAX POST request and populate `request.body`, because data in AJAX POST requests is packaged differently from those in form submissions.

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

### Add POST Route to handle AJAX POST Request

Bind a new POST route to our Express app to receive the AJAX POST request data, create a new `Item` entry in the DB, and return the new item to the client.

### Manipulate DOM with Server Response

After we receive the server response, manipulate the DOM to show the new item in the HTML page.

### Add HTML Input Elements to Accept User Input

Add 2 input fields and a button to the page. When the user clicks the button, read the values in the 2 input fields and send our POST request with that data. Note we do not use a `form` element, because HTML forms do not allow us to easily customise response handling. Thus we define a custom on-click handler for our button that sends an AJAX request on button click to customise how we handle the server response, i.e. to perform DOM manipulation with the response data.
