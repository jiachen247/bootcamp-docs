# 5.2.1: AJAX POST Requests

## Introduction

Use AJAX to create entries in the DB.

## Exercise

### Setup Server and Items Route

1. Clone the [`ajax-bootcamp` repo](https://github.com/rocketacademy/ajax-bootcamp)
2. Install NPM packages
3. Run migrations and seeds with Sequelize. There is a migration and seed file in the repo.
4. Start server locally
5. Visit `http://localhost:3004/items` in the browser to verify the server is set up and the browser can receive items in the response.

### Create New Page With AJAX Request

1. Add a new route for a page
2. Add a view for this page
3. Add a `script` tag to the view page for a JavaScript file called `script.js`
4. Add a JavaScript file called `script.js` to the `public` folder
5. Add a `script` tag to the view page to import Axios

   ```markup
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
   ```

6. Add this Axios example to `script.js`

   ```javascript
   const data = {
     name: 'banana',
     description: 'yellow',
   };

   // Make a request to create an item
   axios
     .post('/items', data)
     .then((response) => {
       // handle success
       console.log(response);
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // handle error
       console.log(error);
     });
   ```

See [more about Axios here.](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/README.md#example)

### Express.js config

We have to add another configuration to Express.js in order for it to accept our POST request. \(This one is slightly different from the HTML form request\). Since we are sending JSON in the POST request we have to tell Express.js to process it into `request.body`.

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

### Manipulate DOM with Server Response

After we receive the server response, manipulate the DOM to show the new item in the HTML page.

### Add Form

Add two input tags and a button to the page. When the user clicks submit, get the values from the two inputs, and send the POST request with that data. \(Note, do not use a `form` element- remember that this is an element that creates a browser request by default. Just create a series of input elements\).
