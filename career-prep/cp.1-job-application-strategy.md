# CP.1: Job Application Strategy

## Introduction

Before we begin compiling our application documents \(portfolio, resume, cover letters, job list\), we can visualise the process over the coming months to mentally prepare ourselves and ensure our documents are best tailored for the companies we are applying to.

## Mental Preparation

Please keep in mind the below points throughout the job application process.

1. **You will get rejections.** This is normal. Take them as a learning experience and address any mistakes you made at future interviews. Sometimes we may not make any mistakes and still get rejected.
2. **You only need 1 company to say yes.** There are always more companies to apply to. Everyone is hiring software engineers.
3. **There is no need to accept the first offers you get if you're not satisfied.** You can afford to wait. Everyone is hiring software engineers.
4. **The job application process can take an indefinite amount of time.** Mentally prepare yourself for this to take months, and prepare your finances accordingly. Rest assured that as long as you keep improving every day, your chances at securing a job will only increase.
5. **Rocket Academy chose you for a reason.** We chose you because we believe you have what it takes to succeed as a software engineer. You just need to work hard, go out there and be yourself.

## Creating Your Strategy

Answer the following questions to better understand your strategy for the job search. This should help you tailor your application documents to be most relevant to each company.

### What kind of engineering or tech role are you looking for?

Coding Bootcamp prepares graduates for full-stack software engineering roles. This means graduates should also qualify for frontend, backend, language-specific, and QA/test roles, and essentially any entry-level coding position. Graduates should also qualify for less technical roles such as product or project management roles.
