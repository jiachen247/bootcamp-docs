# CP.2: Portfolio

## Introduction

Your portfolio is your summary of all the coding work you've done. The goal of the portfolio \(similar to a resume\) is to impress prospective employers, ideally within 5 seconds of them looking at the page, such that they are willing to dig deeper into your projects and code and/or invite you for an interview.

## How to Create Portfolio

To start, you can compile your projects you wish to share into a nicely-formatted page on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/personal). Feel free to format the page however you wish. Notion is free to use, and allows us to publish the pages we create as read-only websites.

If you have time, feel free to create and host your own website in lieu of Notion, e.g. https://johntan.com. This will be more work, but you will have more control over the styling of your page. You can choose to use a website builder such as Squarespace or Webflow for this, or build your own website from scratch \(e.g. Jekyll and GitHub Pages\). If you choose to host your own website, please ensure it is mobile-responsive.

## What Context to Include

1. Brief self-introduction
   1. Who are you?
   2. Why did you choose to be a software engineer?
      1. Note: You are already a software engineer, not an "aspiring" software engineer
   3.  What are you looking for in your next job?
2. Provide context around each project
   1. Project website
      1. Please ensure it is working, and install HTTPS if possible!
      2. Please eliminate bugs as much as possible
   2. Project GitHub link
      1. Please remove commented-out code, clarify variable names, add comments where helpful, and create helper functions where certain logic may be too long, complex, or repetitive.
   3. What technologies did you use
   4. What did you learn from this project?
   5. What was most challenging about this project and how did you overcome it
      1. No more than 1 paragraph
