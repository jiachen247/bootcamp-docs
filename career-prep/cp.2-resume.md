# CP.2: Resume

## Introduction

Your resume is your first impression, and will be 1 of potentially hundreds of resumes a recruiter screens per day. Within 5 seconds the recruiter will use signals such as formatting, coding experience, education history, and spelling/grammar to decide whether to discard you or read further. If they choose to read further, they may spend up to 1 minute on your resume validating whether you can code and whether you might be a culture fit. If you pass, they will likely send you a technical screening test, or less commonly forward you directly to engineers for interviews.
