# 8.1.1: Create React App Full Stack Setup

We will now setup the previous ecommerce full-stack React app in the new Create React App architecture. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cra-arch-2.jpg)

As described before, we will be using 2 completely different repositories to hold the front-end and the back-end of the app.

1. The React app is deployed/started. The Webpack build process is triggered. The resulting files are put into the `/dist` directory, or in development mode, held in the Webpack dev server memory.
2. We type the React app location into the browser: http://localhost:3000
3. The Create React App file server serves the HTML file and the React app JavaScript to the browser. The React app is initialized in the browser.
4. Clicking the "Get Items" button causes an AJAX request to be created inside the React app to: http://localhost:3004/items
5. The request is received at the Express.js server. The app looks in the database for all items and sends back a JSON response.
6. The JSON data is received and processed by the React app. React manipulates the DOM to show the list of items on screen.

## Back-End

The example back-end repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-swe1)

Note that this is the same exact repo as this: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/base-mvc-swe1) from the end of module 4, except for CORS \(discussed below\).

Run the backend app:

```text
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-swe1.git
cd cra-ecom-back-end-swe1
npm install
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npx sequelize db:seed:all
node index.mjs
```

Test the app by visiting the route for items: [http://localhost:3004/items](http://localhost:3004/items)

## Front-End

The example front end repo is here: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1)

Clone and run the front-end app:

```text
git clone https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1.git
cd cra-ecom-front-end-swe1
npm start
```

Note that in order to reach the back-end we had to add a complete hard-coded URL: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1/blob/main/src/App.js\#L10](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1/blob/main/src/App.js#L10)

```text
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3002';
```

We would have to change this hard coded value when we wanted to deploy this app to Heroku. In production this value would be replaced by a value set in an environment variable.  
  
When we make the AJAX request for the list of items we use the variable to construct a complete URL: [https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1/blob/main/src/App.js\#L31](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-front-end-swe1/blob/main/src/App.js#L31)

```text
axios.get(BACKEND_URL+'/items')
```

## CORS

Besides splitting the code of the app into two repos there is only one other major change in how this code works. The [Express.js CORS middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) has been added as a dependency. We use it as middleware in `index.mjs`.  
  
[https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-swe1/blob/main/index.mjs\#L10](https://github.com/rocketacademy/cra-ecom-back-end-swe1/blob/main/index.mjs#L10)

```text
app.use(cors());
```

CORS is a security feature of modern browsers that disallows AJAX requests to a domain that is different from the originating domain.

In our case our requests are originating from localhost:3000 - we want to be able to request data from our back-end server that is running at localhost:3004.

By default Chrome disallows JavaScript from creating these kinds of requests because it is considered a security risk. A malicious attacker could run JavaScript on the page that tries to get some other worse script from another domain controlled by the attacker.
