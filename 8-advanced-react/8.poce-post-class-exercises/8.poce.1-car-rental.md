# 8.POCE.1: Car Rental

## Introduction

Create a React app that rents cars. Use 2 repos, 1 for frontend and 1 for backend. Use Create React App, `useContext` and `useReducer` in the frontend. Use Express, Sequelize, and Postgres for the backend.

### Feature Requirements

1. Create the following pages in the car rental app.
   1. List of cars to rent \(homepage\)
   2. Page for individual car to rent \(user must select rental dates before confirming\)
   3. Rental confirmation page
   4. Rental update or cancellation page
2. To simplify our rental app, all pickup and dropoffs will be from Changi Airport, and cars are only bookable by calendar days, i.e. a car is either booked or not booked on a specific day.
3. Users can filter cars by which days they wish to rent.
4. Feel free to ignore user login for this app if it makes it easier. Anyone can book, update, or cancel reservations.

## Suggested Frontend Components

### All Pages

1. Navbar with link to manage booking \(update or cancel rental\) given booking ID

### Homepage

1. List of cars to rent
2. Filter UI to filter by rental dates

### Individual Car Rental Page

1. Car details
2. Date selection UI \(pre-populated if filtered on home page\)
3. Link to confirm booking

### Rental Confirmation Page

1. Booking ID
2. Rental car and date details
3. Link to homepage

### Manage Rental Page

1. Booking ID
2. Rental car and date details
3. Form to update rental dates if car is available at new dates
4. Link for rental cancellation
5. Link to homepage

## Suggested Database Tables

1. `cars`. Use the faker NPM package in a seeder file to create a pre-populated set of cars to rent in the DB.
2. `bookings`. Store user bookings, including association to relevant car, start date, and end date.
