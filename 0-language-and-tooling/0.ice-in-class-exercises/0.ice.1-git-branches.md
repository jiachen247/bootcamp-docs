# 0.ICE.1: Git Branches

## Introduction

We will practise using Git Branches by creating a new Git repo and branches.

## Create New Repo

1. Create a repo on GitHub.
   1. When creating, choose the option to add a README.md file so the repo does not start empty.
2. Clone the repo.

   ```text
   git clone <REPO_URL>
   ```

3. `cd` into the repo and add the following `index.js` file.

   ```javascript
   let name = process.argv[2];
   console.log(`hello ${name.toUpperCase()}! How are you?`);
   ```

4. Add, commit and push this file to GitHub.

## Create New Branch

1. Checkout a new branch `add-json`. Note that branch names are typically in kebab-case.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-json
   ```

2. Add a `data.json` file to the repo.

   ```javascript
   {
     "names": []
   }
   ```

3. Update `index.js` to contain the following.

   ```javascript
   import { writeFile } from 'fs';
   let name = process.argv[2];
   writeFile('data.json', name, (err) => console.error('err ->', err));
   ```

## Push Branch Changes to GitHub

`git push` needs additional parameters `origin` and target branch name to push feature branches to GitHub because when we run `git push` without params, it pushes the `main` branch by running `git push origin main`. `origin` is the default [Git Remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote.html) that references a remote repo, in this case our GitHub repo. We also need to specify a target branch name so Git knows which branch to push our changes to. By default we always use the local branch name as the target branch name.

1. Run the following command to push changes from `add-json` branch to GitHub.

   ```javascript
   git push origin add-json
   ```

2. After running the above, Git may prompt us to "set an upstream branch", i.e. to set a default branch for this local branch to push to and pull from. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770467/why-do-i-have-to-git-push-set-upstream-origin-branch) is why. Follow instructions in terminal if necessary.
3. Visit GitHub to see what we pushed. Use the branch dropdown as follows.

## Main

1. Checkout `main` and make the following change to `index.js`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(`good day ${name}, are you well?`);
   ```

2. Add, commit and push this change to GitHub.

## Pull Request

When you push to a branch you'll get a GitHub message asking you if you want to make a pull request.

You can click the green button to see a comparison against your main branch \(or any other branch\), and whether or not there will be any merge conflicts. \(Clicking won't actually create a pull request\).

A typical workflow for PRs is to view the code changes in GitHub with convenient highlighting of changes, then go back to our editor to make code changes and test. We can technically make code changes and resolve merge conflicts from within GitHub Pull Requests, but this is discouraged because there is no way to test code changes from within GitHub.

## 2nd User Branch

Add your partner as a contributor to the repo:

1. Go to the settings tab of the repo.
2. Click **Manage Access** on the left side column menu.
3. Click the green **Invite teams or people** button.

Type to autocomplete their GitHub username.

They will receive an email with an invite to collaborate. \(This notification doesn't show up on the GitHub website\).

## Change Partner Repo

Once you are a collaborator, checkout the repo:

```text
git clone <REPO_URL>
```

Create a new branch and make a change to line `2` of the `index.js` file.

```javascript
console.log(`yo ${name}, what's up dude.`);
```

Add, commit and push this change.

## Team Work

When we begin to collaborate on code, a pull request is the main way we'll be able to control what is happening within a project.

Each team mate will create a branch for the feature they are working on and create a pull request when they are done with that feature.

Create a pull request with the changes you made on the branch.

## Git Pull

To get the current set of changes on a branch that exists on GitHub but doesn't exist on your own branch, use `git pull`.

```text
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Note that for now, you have to be on the same branch as the one you are pulling from. Otherwise you are basically doing a merge.

When you do the pull you'll see the code change to the version that is the same as GitHub.
