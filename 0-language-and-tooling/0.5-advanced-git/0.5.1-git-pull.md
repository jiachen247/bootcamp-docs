# 0.5.1: Git Pull

## Introduction

So far we've learned the following.

1. Create a repo on GitHub
2. Fork a repo in Github
3. Clone a repo from GitHub
4. Push local changes to GitHub

Now that we have a 2nd copy of our repo on EC2, we need to keep code in sync between the 2. Specifically, after making changes locally and pushing them to GitHub, we may wish to sync those changes to EC2 without cloning the repo again. 

The solution is `git pull`. Pull retrieves all new changes from a remote repo.

## Example

While SSH'ed into the EC2 instance and in the relevant repo folder, run the following command. There are options we can pass to `git pull`, but those will not be necessary for now.

```text
git pull
```
