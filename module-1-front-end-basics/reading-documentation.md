# Reading Documentation

Due to the very wide scope of the tasks in SWE 1, Google searching for information will become more and more important in order to solve a problem or bug.

As the course moves on the students are expected to become increasingly more independent in their execution of the programming projects. 

Reading the documentation for a given language, framework or library is crucial to moving ahead with a given task. However, this is not a simple task. As you gain more experience you will create your own strategies for how to find and absorb different types of documentation in order to solve a given problem.
